you know , one of the great <unk> in traveling and one of the joys in the research research is to live with the people who remember the old days , and they still feel the past in the wind , touch them in the rain , to the rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of the plant .
simply knowing that <unk> <unk> travel travel from the milky way or the importance of the most of the vulnerability of the baby &apos;s <unk> , or that the the the buddhist of the buddhist , is to <unk> the the world that we live in , not in an absolute sense , but just as a consequence of a reality of the possibility of the <unk> of the possibility that we <unk> , even successful , from many generations ago .
and of course , we all share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we are approaching <unk> .
we need to deal with the <unk> separation through death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sang , dancing and art .
but interesting is the unique tone of the <unk> , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> in the forests of borneo , or the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , or the warrior in the <unk> of <unk> , or a <unk> in the middle of the sahara , or a <unk> in the middle of the sahara , or even a <unk> , i was traveled to the desert a month , or even a <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , everest , the world &apos;s favorite book .
all these people teach us that there are other <unk> , other kinds of ways , the other way to guidance of guidance on earth .
and this is a idea that , if you think about it , can only meet one of hope .
together together , the myriad of developed cultures of the world are a network of <unk> and <unk> life that <unk> earth and probably as important as the earth &apos;s biological <unk> that you know as a biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural <unk> as a <unk> , and <unk> can be reflected as the <unk> of all thoughts and dreams , myths ideas , inspiration and intuitions that have been generated by the human imagination since the beginnings of conscious .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we &apos;re as an amazing species of species .
and just like the biosphere was very hidden , this was happening with the <unk> -- only with even bigger speed .
no biologist would say , for example , that 50 percent or more of all species are just before extinction , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> on the field of biological diversity -- hardly not to what we consider to be a <unk> on the field of cultural diversity .
and the key indicator of this is the origin of languages .
when each one of you were born in this room , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the earth .
now a language is not just the sum of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a certain culture finds access to the material world .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , a inflection point , a thought of a ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting in monterey , that &apos;s exactly the half the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught to be taught by the , which means that if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be more lonely than being the <unk> of being one of the last of your people who speak language , not a possibility of having the wisdom of the ancestors , or expecting hope to expect kids ?
and yet , this terrible fate actually helps someone on earth somewhere about two weeks , because all two weeks , a older person dies , and the last one of the old language of a old language is into the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; and it &apos;s not the world that &apos;s going to be a better place , if we all would just speak language ? &quot; and i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s be this language . let &apos;s be <unk> .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then suddenly you would see what it would be like if you couldn &apos;t talk about your own language .
so i &apos;d like to take you today in a way through the <unk> , a short journey through the <unk> , to try to understand what &apos;s actually gone lost .
now there are some of us who are in the sense that when i say , &quot; different ways of being , &quot; really different ways of being my own .
so for example , take this child &apos;s <unk> in northwest northwest , the people of the <unk> , believe that they were <unk> the <unk> from the east from the west , from saint snakes .
this is a people who are not unlike the color blue and green , because the forest forest is the forest that people depend on , is <unk> .
they have a very curious language and a <unk> called the linguistic <unk> , which is , you have to marry someone who talks about a different language .
all of this is rooted in the <unk> past , and that &apos;s where the big houses of the world are talking about , where because of the <unk> of six or seven languages , they &apos;re never hear anyone who learns language .
you just stop and start talking .
or , of the most fascinating tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , first was contacted in 1958 .
in 1957 , five billboards were trying to record and make a <unk> mistake .
they were <unk> <unk> photos from the air , which we would be adapted to be friendly gesture , and then forgot that these people from the rainforest in their lives had never seen anything .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see behind the face or the character , found nothing , and they were <unk> that the <unk> were the <unk> , and killed the five <unk> with the spear .
but the <unk> aren &apos;t just killing the <unk> .
they <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths were caused by <unk> .
we went back to the eight generations of generations and found two cases of a natural death , and when we were <unk> people with something about it , they gave them that one of the people had become so old , and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time , they had a clear idea of the forest that was amazing .
their homes could smell the urine of a animal from 40 steps away and determine what animal species would be .
in the early 1990s , i got a really amazing job when i was at harvard , i was interested in walking to haiti and to infiltrate the secret societies that were the foundation of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the poison that was used to make <unk> , making sure .
to make this sense of mind , i had to make sense of this remarkable faith of the <unk> knowledge and <unk> , no cult of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex biological worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you , the big world religions , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> or whatever .
a continent is always going to be left , because the evidence was not a religious faith in sub-saharan africa , and of course there was one and <unk> , and there &apos;s just the remains of these very profound religious thoughts that were <unk> in the tragic diaspora &apos; strike .
but what makes so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living are the minds .
the spirits can be <unk> from the large water , answers to the rhythm of the living , to <unk> the soul of living , so that the <unk> for a brief moment is going to be a god .
<unk> , the <unk> likes to say , &quot; your white goes to church and <unk> about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , are you going to put in mind mind . how can you get to ?
look at this amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> coal without burning , an astonishing heart of the mind of the mind of the mind that it &apos;s when it &apos;s going to be a in a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i met , the <unk> from the sierra nevada indian de santa <unk> in <unk> , the most extraordinary .
offspring from the ancient civilization civilization , the heart institute of colombia , and the <unk> of the conquest , this people moved into a <unk> <unk> massive , <unk> , which is the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones who never been conquered by the <unk> .
by the day , they &apos;re governed by a ritual priesthood , but the education is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> are separated at age three and four years from their families , in a shadowy world of darkness , in <unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , and two <unk> years of <unk> , who <unk> to the <unk> of their <unk> mother , they now spend <unk> in the lap of the great mother .
and so all over the time , they &apos;re going to be <unk> into the values of their society , values that sustain claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing brainstorming , you suddenly suddenly take out and take out of your life , and for the first time in your life , at the age of 18 , when the sun begins to the <unk> of the amazing beautiful landscape , suddenly the sun is beginning to be in stunning compelling , and the priest goes back and says , &quot; look , look ? it &apos;s really what i told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call themselves the older brothers and say that we are responsible for the younger brothers , the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
every time we think of the and landscape , we either <unk> and the old nature of the green savage , which in his simplification is an <unk> thought or or <unk> and saying these people are more connected to nature than we do .
so , in <unk> are neither <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> by the <unk> .
there isn &apos;t much place to do in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or the cold winds of tibet , but yet , through time and ritual , they &apos;re shaped a mysterious <unk> of the earth , not based on the idea of being close , but in a very <unk> intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist because it &apos;s pumped into the human mind .
so , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child from the andes who are in believe that the mountain is a <unk> , which is going to be a whole person , and another person on this resource , and another person from montana , who in that belief that a single child from montana , who believe that a mountain is a <unk> that can be eroding .
whether he &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a bunch of <unk> , it &apos;s irrelevant .
and what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that makes the relationship between individual individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> columbia and believed that these forests are there to be <unk> .
and that made me a other people as my friends , the <unk> , who believe that these forests of the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> are , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the world , spirits , they would be in their <unk> .
well , if you start looking at the idea of these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i just just last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , many of you have heard , the strongest <unk> <unk> from the repertoire of the .
what makes so intriguing is not just the most powerful potential of this <unk> , but it &apos;s . it &apos;s made of two different sources . on the one hand , there &apos;s this wooden <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s going to be like a blue <unk> smoke on your consciousness , but it mixes with the leaves of a <unk> from the family &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
this plant contains some very strong <unk> that the serotonin , <unk> and <unk> are very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> of the <unk> , this stuff , these substance that they &apos;re producing from different species also .
so powder powder is about like being a <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to make any distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even with my professor , richard evan <unk> , the man who had pointed the <unk> <unk> with the magic mushrooms in mexico in the <unk> years , and i argued that you couldn &apos;t stand up with the <unk> as a <unk> , because the moment you feel the implications you &apos;re not there to learn a <unk> .
but the thing about <unk> is that they cannot be taken into <unk> because they &apos;re naturally <unk> by a human gut , of course , called <unk> , <unk> .
you can only put in with some other chemicals that are mao &apos;s <unk> .
now the amazing thing is that the <unk> that are in the <unk> are are <unk> of exactly the kind that is necessary to <unk> the <unk> . so ask yourself .
how can these people from a flora of 80,000 species of <unk> plants are not found these two <unk> plants , which , in this way , create a kind of <unk> version , so that the whole larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trial and mistakes , which turns out to be a meaningless .
but you know , you &apos;re telling the indians , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
so this tribe , the <unk> , have 17 varieties of <unk> that you all recognize in big distance in the forest that &apos;s for our eyes as a way of being .
and then you ask them to understand their <unk> , and they say , &quot; i thought you were learning about plants .
i mean , you know nothing at all ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you take each of these 17 varieties of <unk> , and they sing them in one different <unk> .
now , that doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting .
well , the problem is that even those of us , the sympathy for the hard position for the , they &apos;re looking at the <unk> and <unk> , but somehow they &apos;re somehow about the past , as the real world , the world .
so , in fact , in the 20th century , in 300 years , not not for the wars or technological innovation , but rather than an era where we were sitting , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth is either active or active , and the problem is not the change .
all cultures have involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
the <unk> were not less than being on sioux when they were throwing and <unk> , when the americans stopped the american than they were the horse and the <unk> tasks .
it &apos;s not change and technology , the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the rule .
and wherever you go in the world , you &apos;ll find that these cultures are not the doom . these are dynamically <unk> peoples whose existence is <unk> <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
or if we go to tibet , i &apos;m going to see a lot of the <unk> , you will see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the most endangered extinction of people is generally convicted , but the <unk> , the destruction of the lives of people , not only not not just not convicted , but generally , as a as a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the suffering if you don &apos;t have it at the level level .
i went to the with a young fellow <unk> miles of <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , when i came to the texas , i saw the face behind the statistics of whom you hear . 6,000 holy monuments turned into rubble and ashes , 1.2 million people during the cultural revolution .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as followers of the cuban lama .
that meant that during the chinese invasion , he was immediately killed .
his uncle &apos;s uncles with her holiness , which brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked up as punishment -- being wealthy for the crime .
he was taken into jail at two years , to hide under her <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
the sister who did this brave did was put into a <unk> .
she came out of a <unk> <unk> , and for this <unk> , she had to get into a hard for seven years .
suffering suffering can be <unk> , but the <unk> mind of people is something more unusual .
and at the end , we &apos;re really in front of a choice , and we want to live in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist , before she died that it was its greatest fear that , in fact , move toward a thread , <unk> , <unk> reality , we would look at the entire range of human imagination on a <unk> mindset , but we would one day out of a dream , forgetting that there were ever other possibilities .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species has existed for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us agriculture and and at this moment the cult of the <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> , the <unk> of the priesthood and hierarchy and specialization and <unk> -- only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is scarcely 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all answers to the challenges that we face in the ensuing millennia .
if we ask these myriad of <unk> , after the importance of human human , they answer with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will be able to be the possibility of being what we are : people with extended consciousness , who are aware of the importance of being able to thrive , and to be able to be <unk> , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the northern end of the <unk> , when i went to the <unk> on the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the <unk> years , the <unk> of our domination , they were forced to move into settlements .
the guy &apos;s grandfather refused to be himself .
the family that was scared of his life , took him all the guns and all the tools .
now you you know that the inuit don &apos;t have fear of the cold , they use them to their advantage .
the <unk> of their sled were originally made by fish that were made in <unk> .
the man &apos;s grandfather was not worried about the arctic night or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> out , he left his pants from <unk> and he <unk> his hand , and when the feces started to cold , he shaped them in the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> saliva on the sides of the mountain , and when it was completely frozen , he would make a dog with it .
he painted the dog and <unk> a dishes , took the skeleton of the dog and <unk> a <unk> , <unk> a different dog and <unk> over the <unk> with the <unk> .
you can &apos;t do something like that .
and this is a symbol of a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all native americans in the world .
the canadian government gave the the inuit in april 1999 , the full control over an area , greater than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control <unk> .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can be <unk> and achieve the <unk> with his people .
and finally , i think , it &apos;s quite obvious , at least for those of us who &apos;ve traveled to these distant goals of earth , to realize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that are in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children are going to be the dreams of our own children in the process of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe politicians never achieve something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million <unk> every month .
156 nations send our <unk> .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we companies a series of trips to the <unk> , where we take our audience to places from such cultural wonder , and hopefully , one of the world &apos;s <unk> , that the world has made it to exist in a very multicultural way that we can find a <unk> in a really multicultural world where the wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective well-being .
thank you .
what i first do , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we have as part of a <unk> , a a of a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> environment , and it &apos;s an environment where you either can be locally or or with huge amounts of visual data .
we see many , many of of digital photographs here that you &apos;re talking and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photos of a camera , but this is for example , a scan of the <unk> , and it &apos;s in a realm of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that a system like this can be like this is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house from dickens . every column is a chapter .
and to prove that it &apos;s really a text and not a picture , we can do something like this , really , to show that this is a real representation of the <unk> and not picture .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and this really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of reading a real <unk> of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a medium with a multiple scales .
we also did something on the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false display with very high resolution that is much higher than a regular display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specs .
and this really reaches these ideas to allow these restrictions to the available space on the screen .
we hope that this is not a <unk> and other nonsense , that should not be necessary .
of course , this mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time saying , except to say we &apos;re going to contribute to this realm .
but these are all the streets in the outside .
<unk> on the top of the nasa &apos;s image .
let &apos;s take something different now .
now , this is actually live on the internet . you can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which connects really two different technologies together .
one is <unk> , and the other is a very good research on <unk> , who &apos;s from noah <unk> , a university of washington , under the advice of steve <unk> at the <unk> .
and rick <unk> of microsoft &apos;s research was done , very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s powered by <unk> .
you can see that , if we create these kinds of views where we can penetrate through images and make this experience of the <unk> .
but the spatial orientation of the images is actually of meaning .
the <unk> have put these pictures together so they can the real space that they all made near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian desert , and they see elements of <unk> slides or <unk> , and these things were put together in relationship with each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i &apos;ve given you to show you other environments .
there are many that are much more nuanced .
i &apos;d like to show you one of the <unk> <unk> of noah , and this is from a early prototype of <unk> that we &apos;ve been working on in summer to show you what i think is the punchline behind this technology , which is <unk> , and this is not necessarily so obvious if you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to make care of the lawyers so so .
this is a <unk> of the cathedral of notre dame , who was just on the computer with pictures of flickr . just give them notre dame on <unk> and and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the <unk> . and each of these orange cone represents a picture that was discovered as a model of <unk> .
so these are all <unk> , and they all are in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never believed i was going to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
and i guess you can see that these are many different kinds of cameras : everything is from the <unk> to professional <unk> , a quite large number of them that were all in this environment .
and if possible , i will find some of the weird .
many of you are covered by faces , etc .
somewhere here is a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of notre dame who was really recorded right .
we can change the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , and it &apos;s going to collect data from all -- from the whole collective memory of how , visual the earth looks -- and everything is connected to each other .
all of these pictures are connected to each other , and there &apos;s something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all the way .
look at this as the sequel of stephen <unk> &apos;s work on virtual earth .
and this is something that &apos;s through the complexity that people use it , growing and using the user with the use of the more likely .
your own photos are being <unk> with metadata that another person has .
if someone has done the effort and set up all these sacred and and who you are , my photo will be <unk> and <unk> , and i can use them as a starting point to dive into this space , using the photos of other people , and thus doing a kind of <unk> social experience using the use of other <unk> .
and of course , byproduct all of these are the very rich rich models of any interesting part of the earth that are not only received by <unk> or satellite and so on , but by collective memory .
thank you .
. do i understand it right ? your software enables you to be that at a certain moment , all images that are used by someone in the world are being used together , basically , with each other ?
yeah . she doesn &apos;t do anything else .
if you want to build <unk> between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the creation of the information that have a lot of these images .
like , if you do a <unk> for pictures , where you &apos;re making sentences and the text of the website has lots of information about that , which is a picture .
but what about the picture , what if the picture was linked to all of these pictures ?
then the scale of the <unk> and the <unk> that makes it up , it &apos;s really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some of the things from my book , i hope , in the sense of other things that you &apos;ve heard , and i &apos;m going to try to create myself a few connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed .
i want to start with what i call &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
what is the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western industrialized societies .
the official <unk> works like this : if our goal is to maximize the public &apos;s health , this is mainly by the <unk> of the individual .
the reason for that is that freedom in itself is good , valuable , sense , a <unk> premise for human human .
when people have freedom , each of us is about to do the things that our our resources , and nobody has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices have people the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more they have .
this is , i think , deep deep in our supply chain , that it would not come in the sense that it would be .
and it &apos;s also rooted deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . not a big .
i want to just say a little bit about <unk> .
there are 175 <unk> in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t have the 10 10 extra <unk> and 12 strokes that you could buy to make a large number of your <unk> <unk> , in the unlikely case that none of the 175 in the store is right .
so that &apos;s like the supermarket .
and then you go to the <unk> store to a stereo -- speaker , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , <unk> , and in this one electronics , there &apos;s so many <unk> assets .
we can be <unk> million different <unk> assets out of the components that are offered to be offered in this one business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , and you could have any phone party on the phone , and you wanted to be as long as he was from the bell bell .
they have rented their phone . they don &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of the was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we have now almost an infinite choice of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that until now , you can be sure you &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is it brings people to walk into business and ask them this question .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are much more comfortable than buy of objects , the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could make a a or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and you say , &quot; doc , what do i want ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risk .
what do you want to do ?
and when they say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
the result is -- we call it patients &apos; patients . it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a <unk> of responsibility for making someone &apos;s knows -- <unk> of the doctor -- to somebody who knows something -- and not sick , and not in the best constitution is to make a decision -- <unk> the patient .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for <unk> drugs like you and me , that , if you think about it , it doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is , you expect us to call us the doctor in the morning and ask for a change of the prescription .
something as <unk> as our identity is now a question of choice , how this slide is supposed to be .
we don &apos;t touch identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re developing as much as we want .
that means that every day you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the <unk> was that almost everybody had one and they could get as fast as they could , and then they got the as fast as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and what they did after that .
now , all of this is just to have .
i teach wonderful young students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and they &apos;re not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? &quot; now , should i marry married ?
should i get married ? should i have children , or just a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all <unk> questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions irrespective of whether this means to do all the tasks that i &apos;m going to do and not get good note in my class .
and in fact , you should do that . these are important to ask questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl <unk> , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every place on the planet -- to the <unk> hotel .
and there &apos;s a corner , by the way , i &apos;m not going to tell you where the <unk> works .
i won &apos;t tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions , again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can play our kids at soccer , and we have our mobile phone on the hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably probably on our lap .
and even if they &apos;re all gone , every minute in which we &apos;re going to be a child at <unk> a <unk> , we &apos;re asking , &quot; should i accept this call ?
should i answer that email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly your experience of your child &apos;s experience very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things , material things , material things , lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world that we lived in was this .
and i want to say , there were some choices , but not all was a question of choice .
and the world that we &apos;re now living in is this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to do about what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
an effect , <unk> , is that it &apos;s going to be <unk> instead of free .
so with so many options you can choose , it &apos;s very hard to decide to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of a study of a study of investment in volunteers .
one of my <unk> had access to <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 percent <unk> that the employer was <unk> , took participation by two percent .
they offer 50 50 <unk> -- 10 percent less staff , part than if they were only five , why ?
because it &apos;s 50 <unk> that are available to choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what you want to do in tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never come .
now understand that that &apos;s not just that people have to eat when they retire in retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go , it means that decisions make a lot of time to miss their employer .
and the <unk> , they &apos;re not spending up to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the <unk> , who would have been happy to reproduce their contributions .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
they want to really make the decision really , if it &apos;s all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or the wrong thing .
so this is the one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up getting less happy with the outcome of choice than if we had had the opportunity to choose between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is flowing through the vast array of different <unk> , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what happened is that this bizarre <unk> <unk> , that , and that regret is a negative to the happiness , and that regret is negative on the happiness that they had made a decision for the happiness that they made made by their previous decision , even if it was a good decision .
the more options there are , the more easy it is at all to regret , that &apos;s disappointing to the choice they meet .
secondly , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert did a big point today in the morning by telling how much the way we evaluate things about what we compare to .
well , if there &apos;s lots of alternative to concerns , it &apos;s just attractive to imagine what alternatives you exclude , that makes you less happy with the alternatives that you chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they should have thought .
so here &apos;s a couple of on the hamptons .
very expensive .
beautiful beach . great day . they have it all for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; bloody &quot; of the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s about two weeks of the thought he missed the possibility of having a great parking day .
<unk> , the happiness that we get from our choice , even if we &apos;re chosen to be fantastic .
and the more ways there are choices , the more attractive traits of these choices are going to consider in the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon does some statements .
he &apos;s making a statement on the now and maybe doing things slowly .
but a important point that he does is always who they choose to decide to do , they don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things like lots of attractive traits , and it will do what they &apos;re going to do to do less <unk> .
third : <unk> of expectations .
this made me when i was trying to exchange my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time when there was only jeans of a species , and they bought them , and they were bad , they were incredibly <unk> , and if they carried them enough enough and often enough enough , they started to go .
so , to buy new jeans after many years of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the sales said , &quot; do you want to be <unk> , <unk> or long ?
do you want to wash buttons or or <unk> ? stone or acid ?
do you want to have jeans with holes ?
if you want to cut down , <unk> , blah blah blah blah , and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i would like the way the only way to be . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour for all of these bloody jeans , and i &apos;ll get the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best of the jeans i had ever had .
i had better . all these choice allowed me to have better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain me .
the reason i was worse felt bad with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good pair of jeans was going on .
i had very low expectations . i had no a concrete expectation than just had in a kind .
when they got in 100 species , they had , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i got to what i expected , and what i had been disappointing to what i expected .
the addition to that to people &apos;s lives inevitably , the expectations of people have to about how well these are going to be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of the <unk> knows this , because if you would , you all wouldn &apos;t know what it &apos;s going on .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that used to be better than anything was worse than anything was worse , was to make it possible for people to make a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world we live -- we wealthy citizens , with perfection as a expectation -- the best for you can ever hope is things as good as you expect it .
they &apos;ll never pleasant <unk> because their expectations , my expectations , are <unk> .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what they all have -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short short moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t get myself .
but <unk> isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of the <unk> of a bad line is when it &apos;s just a way to buy , that if you &apos;re dissatisfied , and you ask questions why , who is responsible , the the world is responsible . what would you have done ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans available , and you &apos;re a the disappointing , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
but it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is , you .
they could have done it better .
with a hundred different kinds of jeans in the <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , people make decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it , they accuse themselves .
clinical depression blew the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only , but a <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned the disappointing because their standards are so high , and then when they need to explain these experiences , they think it &apos;s their fault .
and so the <unk> is that it &apos;s generally better to us , and we &apos;re really , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official <unk> , which is one that we all think is right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s better than not , but it doesn &apos;t that more choice is better than choice .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we missed the point of the fact that we have a democracy that we have .
now , as a policy question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a policy question , the thing about thinking about . what all of these choices are possible in the industrialized societies , the material wealth .
there are many lot of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them whose problem is not the big choice .
your problem is they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a very curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and frustrating is , steve <unk> tells you about how this expensive and difficult to do more car seats , it &apos;s not a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t .
they even hurt .
they &apos;re going to make that feel bad .
if something of what makes people &apos;s society allows us to meet the societies in which people would lead to little choices , not only the lives of people would improve , but we would be improved .
economists call this a <unk> application .
<unk> is going to make sure that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all these big choices are fooled .
finally , please read this cartoon , and , you know , a ridiculous person , say , &quot; ah ! what about this fish ?
you know nothing about that in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> fantasy , a <unk> view of the world -- and that is the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the idea that the fish would know something .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> , so that everything is possible , you have no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the <unk> , everything is possible , it &apos;s going to lower the happiness .
they increase paralysis and lower happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost to be <unk> security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> is his by a <unk> <unk> recipe for misery , and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code to a new phase of biology by creating new life and building new life .
we always have tried to ask major questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think is a lot of biologists trying to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve been nearly 20 years . when we sequenced the <unk> ratio , the change from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now , let &apos;s try to wonder whether we can regenerate life or can we make new life , this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , <unk> <unk> , who has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do it with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve managed to dispense about a hundred genes from the 500 or something like this .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple compared to ours . trust me , that &apos;s straightforward . but if we look at all those genes that we can one after one after one after another , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to move on this chromosome actually actually to <unk> what we can to replicate and make some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started to the question , can we put a chromosome ?
does chemistry make these really large molecules that have never been done before ?
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is so by by the way , just a piece of chemical chemical material .
our steps at the <unk> of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has been very slow , but yet our final point is going to be on an exponential curve .
we started with this 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years to start with a <unk> review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out , it &apos;s very difficult to do .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that little bits of dna , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , but it &apos;s a continuous process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method with which we could put these little pieces and put the mistakes .
so this was our first first attempt to start with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria .
we made small pieces , we made a <unk> and had dna molecule , about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of <unk> chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacterium began reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then <unk> off the cells , and they came back and killed e. coli .
and recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that they were this model .
they laughed more than you do here .
so we think that this is actually a situation in the software that can actually build your hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole <unk> chromosome . it &apos;s like we were building , and it was like we were building it in cassette cassette from the size of the virus that we could vary the size of the tapes to understand what the individual components of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information needs to be really <unk> .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the <unk> was a mistake to a <unk> .
we found the <unk> 30 mistakes . if we used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to create pieces that are the 50 letters long , and they have to be collected with other <unk> of to build smaller <unk> to build the ones .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built <unk> .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t.
<unk> of these letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
initially we just signed up .
some people were disappointed that it was not a poetry .
we &apos;ve made the bits so that we could easily break it with enzymes , and there &apos;s enzymes that are fixing these and <unk> .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that <unk> the five to <unk> letters , and then these together to make <unk> to make these back together to <unk> .
every step , we made these pieces of surplus in order to sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process , which they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of <unk> .
so , looks like a <unk> .
if we get to these really big pieces -- over 100,000 pairs of food -- they &apos;re not just grow in e. coli , it &apos;s increasing all the the of modern molecular biology , and we &apos;re starting to get out of other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of <unk> <unk> called the biology , using biology to repair dna that can bring these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there is an organism called <unk> <unk> , the three million rads of radiation .
you can see in the upper field that its chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , it has been as repeated as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely cut , they can even live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space and can move to the search for extraterrestrial conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are many lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we &apos;ve created by using these processes -- actually , we used only <unk> using the proper design of the pieces , and we put it in the <unk> , and then yeast falls together .
this is not a <unk> <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s a big molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
this is footage over a period of six seconds .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve just completed recently .
this is over <unk> &apos;s characters , <unk> code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure ever created by people .
it &apos;s got a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we plot it with a <unk> of 10 and without distances , it would include <unk> pages , just to harness this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
it &apos;s obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier to get in <unk> like we are , you just take the nucleus out and put another in , and that &apos;s exactly what you all heard about the cloning .
and in <unk> , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but we &apos;ve shown that you can make a full transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate them .
we <unk> the chromosome of a <unk> , roughly , these two are from the way from from the way around humans and mice . we were giving some <unk> to <unk> the chromosome . and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and they &apos;re going to treasure our very <unk> graphs here .
the new chromosome went to the cell .
in fact , we thought that here is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to bring the process to .
this is the evolution of evolution here .
we find all sorts of species here that have taken a second chromosome or a third of <unk> , every time of thousands of characteristics in a second to a species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that has changed at a time , has missed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the <unk> , which actually actually digest dna .
the chromosome was in the cell ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve collected .
it was deposited in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we ended up with a cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> blue because of the genes that we had collected .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and <unk> completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given to the cell .
all the proteins change changed -- the membranes changed -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we were going to have .
it may sound like genomic <unk> , but we can move by changing the circuitry , things quite dramatically .
now , i &apos;ve argued that this is not the <unk> -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i have argued that we might be able to create a new kind of cambrian explosion where there could be massive new <unk> based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s quite obvious in what we need .
we &apos;re going to go from six billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on the planet are in the country for each of the years , it &apos;s going to be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for coffee billion people .
it will provide a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion barrels a day . that &apos;s a hundred million <unk> a day .
when we think about biological processes or any kind of process to replace this , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material landing in the atmosphere .
we &apos;ve now , from our discoveries around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we &apos;re going to start in the limits of the biological reality and to the of our imagination .
we have technologies today because of this fast <unk> , to do what we call <unk> genetics .
we have now the ability to build a big robot building the a million chromosomes a day .
if you imagine to imagine those 20 million different genes or optimize these processes to optimize <unk> or drugs , we can only change a little bit more molecular than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can go through <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> , and so on .
this is a shot of the real <unk> that we &apos;re working on , which you &apos;re actually putting up and doing new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it looks like . we know exactly what their genetic code is going to look like .
now , we &apos;re focusing on the the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve recently seen corn corn corn , which is just a bad experiment .
we have the <unk> of the <unk> and third generation that will be relatively soon , have a much higher <unk> of <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way we think of biology , we have a huge impact on food or limitation of the cost of food , when we see co2 as a text , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go this way .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first with the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , almost <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s carbon in methane in the use of hydrogen as a source .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use <unk> co2 , which could easily be <unk> , <unk> the co2 in fuel to make this process .
within a short period of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the basic questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> targets like the energy of the <unk> industry . right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , wherever else ? a <unk> of energy .
but we &apos;re working on the same way that we &apos;re using the same approaches for developing vaccines .
you saw it with flu this year , we &apos;re always a year back and you have a dollar to little when it &apos;s about the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by creating <unk> vaccines in the <unk> .
this is what the future might look like with changes today , can accelerate the <unk> with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and potentially <unk> .
we &apos;re more distant from that , and our goal is just that we have a chance to survive a long enough to do that . thank you very much .
at the last ted conference , i gave a primer to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so , and for all of those who were not there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever ever been addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that are less than a quarter second a second , the universe -- and that &apos;s up to 600 million times in a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we &apos;re taking pictures of these <unk> in detectors .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing . he &apos;s called atlas , 44 meters in the diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of atlas in the construction , so you see the scale .
on september 10 , last year , the machine went on the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it &apos;s growing huge <unk> in the control control .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> that all the way around the lhc , then <unk> with a part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this image on the 10th of september , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was created the largest <unk> , or this as someone went to the google side and put the front page together .
it means that we have a cultural impact alongside the scientific world .
there &apos;s about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires -- these these these these these <unk> wires here .
these wires run <unk> when the machine runs on <unk> .
now , the engineers among you are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that , because if you roll them up very long , they become called <unk> .
so at negative degrees , , , than the space between the stars , these wires can withstand tension .
in one of the connections between the <unk> magnet in the lhc , there was a <unk> .
and the wires are <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , suddenly <unk> <unk> .
this was the result .
now , this is even more problematic when you imagine that the magnet is over 20 tons and shifted to about 30 inches .
so we &apos;re about 50 magnets .
and they had to take away what we did .
we <unk> them , they <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
by the end of march , the lhc will be <unk> .
we will turn it back , and we &apos;ll be able to collect data on june or july , and we &apos;re going to go on and go out and find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in some kind of <unk> , the debate was about the value of science and science of the boundaries of this . it &apos;s easy to reject something like this .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words to a english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s the most <unk> experiments of his <unk> defended , his apprentice was michael <unk> , who said that &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the development of the human mind , than to that our scientific ideas are <unk> , that our scientific beliefs are <unk> , and there are no new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a novelist .
writing books is my profession , but it &apos;s more of course than that .
it &apos;s also my big , <unk> love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change .
but , , recent has happened something funny in my life and my career that i &apos;ve made me completely rethink my relationship with this work .
this curious event was that recently wrote a book -- a biography called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> -- -- that , decided , unlike all my previous books for some reason , went out and found a big <unk> , international <unk> .
the result is that i don &apos;t matter where i &apos;m going to be treated as i am the most likely .
seriously , the doom of <unk> !
for example , you &apos;re going to get to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you feel you &apos;re going to be <unk> that success ?
do they have any fear of being their whole life and never creating a book that wants to be interested in the world ? never again ? <unk> .
okay , that &apos;s what makes really courage .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was going to be a teenager for over 20 years when i first told the i wanted to be writer , who was the same kind of <unk> response .
people said , &quot; don &apos;t you afraid to have successful ?
did you feel that you kill the humiliation of a leader ?
do you feel that you &apos;re going to live your life for your life and never get it out of it and you &apos;re going to die on a <unk> <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ? <unk> ?
that &apos;s kind of , you know .
and the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : <unk> yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all of this .
and i had that .
and i was a lot more things that nobody would get to solve .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but when i &apos;m writing about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about this , and i ask myself , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that that from somebody should be expected , fear of doing the work that he feels to do ?
and what exactly is it about the creative framework that they &apos;re going to make us self-conscious about the quality of state -- in a way that other professions do ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as chemists asked if he was afraid to be a chemist .
with your favorite , john -- how do you do it with it ?
it just wasn &apos;t there , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not given the call of <unk> people &apos;s <unk> .
we seem to have this kind of call , but not only the writers , but the writers of all the <unk> seem to have this call , to be mentally tremendously unstable .
all they need to do is to look at the bitter <unk> of really great minds alone from the 20th century , who were young and often by their hand .
and even those who were not actually committed to be seemed neglected by their talents .
norman <unk> said a little before his his last interview , <unk> each of my books has killed me a little bit further .
an extraordinary statement that they can do about their lives .
but we don &apos;t even get to say that we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve known this kind of time , because we &apos;ve somehow learned the perception of the and collective , and that creativity and suffering somehow somehow , and that art -- at the end -- always leads to the <unk> .
the question i want to ask anybody here today is : is this idea of all right ?
do you think i &apos;d have seen it ? because with just one centimeter of view -- i don &apos;t think i &apos;m comfortable with this idea .
i find them up .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch it &apos;s taken to the next century .
i think better if we &apos;re our our great creative friendship .
and i definitely know that -- in my situation -- very dangerous , start to start this dark path of vision , sort of -- especially in my career , i &apos;m in my career .
that is , you know , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i have maybe another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s really probably that everything i &apos;m going to write from the world now is the work that is ranked after the <unk> success of my last book , right ?
i say it <unk> because we &apos;re all sort of friends here -- it &apos;s probably probably that my biggest success is behind me .
oh jesus , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that somebody can get to start at nine in the morning , drink gin , and i don &apos;t want that .
i &apos;d rather want to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
now , after the time of the <unk> , i seems to me that i can continue to write , to write a kind of <unk> psychological foundation .
somehow i have to find out a way to do a safe distance to true between me and my very natural <unk> about how the reaction to the <unk> .
and i &apos;ve been looking for models for the last year to do this , i &apos;ve been searching for the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find out to find other societies to see if they had better or more ideas about that than we could help with the emotional risks that are linked to creativity .
this quest led me to the old greece and the ancient rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in the old greece and rome , people don &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , ok ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , which was from a distant , unknown source to people -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> .
now , from socrates , he believed he had a <unk> who was <unk> him out of a distance .
the romans had the same idea , called the kind of <unk> creative mind a <unk> genius .
that &apos;s great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical <unk> creature , was believed that it was literally in the walls of a <unk> -- sort of like <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artist in a way invisible <unk> and the result of the work .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construction that you &apos;re talking about , the psychological movement that you &apos;re going to protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew it worked so , right ?
the artist of the <unk> was in certain things , like , &quot; well , too much , right ?
when your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t be looking at you , everyone knew you had this <unk> genius that helped you .
if your work is <unk> -- not &apos;t make your mistake , right ?
everybody knew your genius was a little bit paralyzed .
so , in the west , people in the west have thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance came , and we had this big idea . and this big idea was , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- across all the gods and the <unk> , and there &apos;s no room for mystical creatures that are orders of the divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people began to think that creativity came completely from their individual .
for the first time in history , you hear this or you call people who are an genius -- instead of having a genius .
i have to tell you , i think it was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a naked person to allow you to think that he or her , is like the vessel , the <unk> and the source of all divine , creative , <unk> , endless <unk> is a little too much responsibility to make them a little bit of responsibility , to <unk> them .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
the <unk> and distorted whole egos , and it creates all this <unk> expectations to success .
i think that <unk> has wiped our artists &apos; artists for the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , -- and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
perhaps to a ancient understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just eliminate the <unk> from 500 years of rational humanism in a <unk> talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who really prefer <unk> scientific doubt about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , people <unk> and <unk> on their projects and so on .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to add is , why not ?
why not thinking about that ?
because it makes the much sense as anything that i &apos;ve heard when it was to explain the absolutely crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process that -- like everyone knows who has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everybody here is -- not always not always reasonable .
in fact , sometimes he can feel <unk> .
i had a encounter recently , when i met the extraordinary american poet <unk> stone , who was now 90 , but she was told to she was in the <unk> virginia , and she told me she was working out in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear , &quot; a poem about landscape landscape on her .
she said it was like a <unk> train from air .
they would go over the land to them .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet to the quake .
she knew that she could only do one thing like this , and that was -- in her words -- <unk> running like the devil <unk> .
they ran like the devil in the house while they were tracked by this poem , and it was just that she had to get fast enough to a sheet of paper and a pen , so they had to get it through it , to catch up and capture on the sheet .
in other things , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she did not reach the house and she would take the poem through her , and she would it , and she would say it would go on and -- and she said , &quot; <unk> after another poet . &quot;
and then there were these moments -- i &apos;m never forget -- she said that there were moments in which she was almost <unk> .
she &apos;s sitting down to the house looking for paper , and the poem is going through her , and she &apos;s taking a pencil when she was through her , and then -- she -- she said , she was like to reach up with her other hand and get it to stand .
she caught the poem at his tail , and she pulled it back in her body , and took it to the paper paper .
so these opportunities came up with a poem and and on the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word for the first .
when i heard that , i was really curious about this , which is exactly how my creative process is going on .
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a <unk> . i have to get up every day at the same time , and break up , and i &apos;m really embarrassed and really awkward .
but even i have in my <unk> , sometimes this thing .
and i guess many of you have done that .
even i had worked or ideas that come from a source of me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what what is this thing ?
and how do we get to lose our minds with this without losing our minds , but to keep ourselves in the opposite of mental health ?
for me , the best living example of how you could do this can be the musicians tom <unk> , and i was interview it for a few years ago .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his time , tom was the embodiment of the <unk> modern artist who was trying to master these <unk> creative impulses that were in him and to them .
but then he was older and quiet . he told me that he was going to go on a freeway one day in los angeles , and all of this changed for him .
he was driving at high speed when he &apos;s a little fragment of a melody , which , as a lot of time , is difficult for him to be difficult for him , and he wants to . it &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s <unk> , but he can &apos;t do it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so he starts to get this old <unk> in him , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing and and i will be followed by this song on forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t have it .
but instead of having to panic , he just stopped listening .
he ended up carrying all the whole , and he did something completely new .
he just looked into the sky and he said , &quot; sorry sorry , can you see that i drive a car ? <unk> ?
<unk> look , i look like i could just put a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a <unk> moment , if i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , somebody else today .
go and <unk> leonard cohen . <unk> .
his whole <unk> has changed after that .
not the work itself . it still has been as dark as ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that surrounds him was <unk> when he was the genius of himself , where he didn &apos;t get anything to do , and he was going to <unk> him where he was in , and he realized that it wasn &apos;t a <unk> , gnarly thing .
there could be a <unk> , miraculous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , mass thing that was not quite tom .
as i heard this story , it also changed the way i worked and i had saved me .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love , love , and i fell in one of these <unk> of the junk we all fall on , when we work on something and didn &apos;t work . you start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster . it &apos;s ever written .
not just bad , but worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just do this project .
but then i remembered tom was talking to the free sky , and i tried to .
so i took my view of the manuscript and i was talking to my comment toward a blank corner of the room .
i was talking to the <unk> : <unk> , you know , you know , you and i both know if this book is brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i &apos;m all going to do , i &apos;m not having any more than that .
so if you want to do it better , you have to look up here and you have to measure your height of deal .
ok . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , the hell with it .
i &apos;m going to write , , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to ask you to do that today i was for my part of the jobs .
because ... and at the end , it &apos;s like following . centuries ago , in the deserts , <unk> people with holy dances and music , who were been stopped for hours -- until dawn .
these solid were always great , because the dancers were <unk> , and they were fantastic .
but , again , very rare , something special happened . one of the performers was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know that all of you have seen such a performance in your life .
it was like the time <unk> and the dancer was <unk> , and he didn &apos;t do anything different than he ever did -- 1,000 nights earlier , but everything together together .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t find any much longer in the human .
it was moved from the inside and the bottom , and everything <unk> through a fire fire .
so something that happened then , the people knew what this was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together , they started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historic <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> brought them to practice this practice , and the pronunciation helped the centuries of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which you still hear about <unk> and <unk> .
if an artist in spain , something impossible , something magical : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> view of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning , when the dancer himself wakes up and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer wearing a <unk> of god .
he &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> knee , and maybe he &apos;ll never get up to those heights .
and maybe someone &apos;s never name to name god , if he turns around , but what do he do to do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most <unk> offenders of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of <unk> if they didn &apos;t believe in the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of their existence come from them .
if you may just believe that you &apos;re a <unk> -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> period of your life that someone else is passed away when you &apos;re ready to do it .
so if we start thinking about it this way , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think of security in the last few months , as i was working on this book that &apos;s soon -- as the dangerous , terrifying , powerful , powerful successor to my <unk> success .
what i have to say myself , when i &apos;m going to get crazy about this , is not fear .
don &apos;t be <unk> .
just do your job .
be still for your contribution to whatever it is .
if your job is dancing , dance dance .
if the dumb genius genius you ask you to do is , you decide to give a a preview of miracles through your effort , then <unk> <unk> !
and if it wasn &apos;t , dance , it &apos;s your dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , for all .
i think that and i feel like we should teach that .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , for example , just for you to just the mere human love and the <unk> , to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic <unk> that the arctic of the bottom of the bottom 48 states had been to 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t really affect the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of ice .
in a sense , the arctic is <unk> the beating heart of our global <unk> .
it &apos;s growing in winter and <unk> in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a <unk> , which has happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is labeled red .
as you can see , it grows on the <unk> . this is the annual ice in winter ; it &apos;s <unk> in summer .
this is called the <unk> , five years old or older , almost like blood , which is out of the body here .
it &apos;s gone from here in 25 years .
this is a problem because the warming is the frozen cause of the arctic ocean , where there are large amounts of carbon dioxide , which is when it comes out of microbes to methane .
compared to the entire amount of <unk> substances in the atmosphere , this amount could double when we cross that critical point .
already , in some flat <unk> in alaska , in a <unk> of thickness of itself .
professor <unk> walter in the university of alaska , with another <unk> , traveled to another flat lake last winter .
wow !
you &apos;re fine . the question is , how will it going to be us ?
and one reason is , this enormous <unk> <unk> greenland is greenland .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume is much greater than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level through <unk> is going up , you can get into the sea .
these rivers are getting very rapid .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest <unk> on the planet .
last month , researchers gathered that the entire continent has now a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that &apos;s collected over a few of the <unk> is particularly strong .
this is equivalent to 20 feet of water , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , the top new lakes that were <unk> a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world are getting half of their <unk> from this <unk> .
in the andes , this glacier is the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> have <unk> .
but when you get out , the most water will be <unk> .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the european union region was seen .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
this <unk> , in the world , leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and disasters all over the world have actually gained in a really , really unprecedented , unprecedented extent .
four times in the last 30 years , like in the <unk> <unk>
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it &apos;s doing .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve done 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day into the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific pacific , of the american continent , <unk> and <unk> of indian <unk> , where there is a subtle decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the third largest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest <unk> , together with china .
and the proposal was to build many more <unk> .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
here are those who were been <unk> in the last few years , some green alternatives that were proposed .
there is a political dispute in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollar last <unk> to promote clean coal , which is already a contradiction in itself .
this image reminded me of something .
around christmas , i was in tennessee for me , a billion tons of <unk> .
you saw it in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> america .
this is after christmas .
one of the commercials for the christmas morning was about christmas .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happy guy .
it &apos;s got a <unk> and a lot of wealth in america , and it &apos;s helping to grow our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> will cleaner every day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers stay in sales and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me say a clearly . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance of climate rights has been building two campaigns .
this is one , one part of it .
we &apos;re seeing climate change as a serious danger to our business .
so we put it to the top <unk> , spend a significant <unk> of <unk> to get a <unk> on the way to the truth of coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells even good .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
keep it out of that .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of these modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet , burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable <unk> <unk> that you see here changes everything .
look at this carefully , this is the today , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects all of them together is our dependence on <unk> fuels like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us out of this <unk> situation .
<unk> america at 100 percent clean electricity within the next 10 years .
plan to bring america back to work , to make us safer and help us stop the global warming .
finally , a solution , which is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find out more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on the old , filthy fuels that make us reduce our world .
the future is here . wind , sun , and new energy system .
new investments to create well paying jobs .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to come , go together . &quot;
we have to come far , and we have to go fast .
thank you .
i want to start by asking you to look at the time of your childhood when you played with <unk> .
and as they realized how to take the hands apart and <unk> , the <unk> and moves , they actually learned to think about and understand problems through understanding and changing the underlying patterns .
the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand most of our environment .
as a scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- with my collaborator <unk> and my colleagues <unk> , i began to wonder , what if we could interfere with both the <unk> <unk> -- what if we could interfere with both hands and and the data and and they could build it as way we wanted ?
this question was so emotional that we decided to explore the answer to the answer and the answer .
in short , a <unk> is a interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can be moved by hand , you can see each other , you can detect your movements , and you have a screen and a <unk> .
most importantly , are physically , so you can just move them like <unk> just through the outside of your hands and access .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to manipulation of digital data .
and when these tools are being physical and they &apos;re an awareness for their motions , each other and the subtleties of our <unk> perceive with them , we can start to explore new and meaningful <unk> .
i start with some simple examples .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> , and when i go into it , it &apos;ll roll the video forward , and if i put it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
so if i put them side-by-side , they &apos;re their interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by , you notice that , and you can get a little nervous .
and they feel also their motions and their <unk> .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could apply everyday gestures to data , like <unk> , like , to do this with liquids .
in this case , we have three <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to paint color in the middle in the middle , where they &apos;ll mixed .
if we overdo it , we can make a little bit of <unk> .
there &apos;s also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math or <unk> , where we can give people the opportunity to get the to and see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci version i &apos;m making with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words that are kind of a mixture of a and <unk> .
basically , you get every round of music on every single <unk> , randomly <unk> letters , and you try to make words , you &apos;re going to have a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , again , you have a new <unk> and new opportunity to try .
thank you .
these are some kids who came to the media lab , i could move them to try and get it and took a video of it .
they really loved it .
and a interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; use words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s a couple of people who test it .
this is our current <unk> down there on the lower right .
it turns out he wanted to stack the <unk> .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by <unk> the <unk> of the table that shows this character .
here it is the sun is <unk> .
the sun rises up .
now he &apos;s taking a tractor into the scene .
the orange is <unk> .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the <unk> and and he can put the characters together ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide how it develops .
flying cat .
the last example i i &apos;ve spent time to show it is a <unk> for <unk> that we &apos;ve recently developed and in the <unk> as sound , like <unk> , bass and musical act .
each has four different variations ; you can select which you want to use .
and you can put those notes into the sequence that you can put in any patterns .
and you put them in by holding a <unk> on a <unk> .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filters .
you put it with a specific note and then you to the <unk> .
and then the persistent effects like speed and volume that you do on the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start in which we &apos;re going to put the <unk> in two <unk> and put them in a row , expand them and add a little bit more of the voice .
now , i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something drums more .
and now i plug the filter with the drums so i can steer the effect live .
i can accelerate all the sequence by looking at the speed in one direction or another .
and now i plug the filter on the <unk> , for something more expression .
i can split the sequence while it &apos;s going to change .
and i don &apos;t have to plan them in the front of the , but it can be improvise ; it &apos;s <unk> .
and finally , i can browse all the sequence by stepping down the staples to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire is to develop new <unk> , which is better to fit how our brains and bodies work .
and i had time to show you a part of this new <unk> and some of the ways we work in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you is is that we are at the cusp of this new generation of <unk> to the digital media that we have to have information in our world that is our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to all of you .
yes , good afternoon .
i &apos;m very excited that i am there .
yeah , so what what is going to be ?
i have to step back to this , and i &apos;m going to start with the modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology and i &apos;ve been looking at the <unk> now for a few years now , and that &apos;s what i started to do , because i wanted to know a little bit more about what i learned in studying theoretically .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i was kind of like to get into matter , like this .
i think that the molecular biology now , so generally , , biotechnology , everything you do about , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now , already , it &apos;s extremely important and much more , is going to be much more important in the future .
there are so many things that are changing the way these all genetically engineered plants .
there &apos;s now craig venter &apos;s now in the <unk> that &apos;s trying to make <unk> , so gas from algae .
and then , there are things that are really stuck in the everyday , which is not aware of most people , but for example , <unk> that allow us to wash with 40 degrees , we &apos;re also <unk> enzymes .
and the list can continue to continue .
and so from that interest , this technology , i &apos;m just going to go on to the further .
so why now , hack ?
most people know that most of the people from the <unk> .
computers hack , and then it will always be like this , yes , the hackers break down somewhere and and they have claws and so on .
and that &apos;s kind of a <unk> , very sad because it doesn &apos;t happen what it actually started to do , and what &apos;s really behind .
and that &apos;s the <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> with <unk> , and it also came out of the internet .
and it &apos;s about a sense of an absolute , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and problem , that &apos;s not just an technological problem , it can be a social problem , it can be be a <unk> , which is like things like things , a question of <unk> , a question , and how can you do it differently , or how do you do it .
and it &apos;s been done with software , but there &apos;s also in the <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole <unk> that &apos;s done with <unk> all kinds of <unk> things .
and now , just towards biology , and i want to ask this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , biology is actually a <unk> code , because , it &apos;s a ridiculous code that &apos;s , it &apos;s a dynamic code , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s matter , it &apos;s real matter , and not just <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and it can also program that , and it can also hack it , and that &apos;s what i found incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
this actually has <unk> eight eight really <unk> , these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , and it &apos;s with europe and with a cooperation in india , <unk> network , but now members , active people all over the world .
that &apos;s what &apos;s more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s lots of artists and philosophers and in collaboration with scientists with scientists to come up with these technologies and places and process the creative , there &apos;s <unk> and yes , all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s really about trying to find a kind of <unk> access to that kind of thing that we have with this .
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> a network , and this is actually a kind of forum where you &apos;re going to be and online and discussing online .
they &apos;re a little technical , and also a little bit of <unk> , and then they &apos;re asking questions .
and based on these networks that made all the popular popular , we have just developed a scene that i want to <unk> for a second .
in the image on the top left here , you see <unk> , which is a <unk> , so basically a school , a private school , a private school , a non-profit group , where everybody can get .
kids , old , all kinds of people , go to the way to just do it , they have a lab and look at what you can do when they &apos;re going .
there &apos;s a group on the bottom down there , called the <unk> , which is , but it &apos;s quite a long time .
longer than these other networks .
they &apos;re also involved in a artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , also <unk> , and it &apos;s a very <unk> way .
a group of ankara , a while ago , who have met this is a <unk> , which is a <unk> , which is to give more to the public to do more what they &apos;re learning in college , and they &apos;ve done so on <unk> small actions and and people try to explain what &apos;s <unk> .
and i have a lecture on the other in copenhagen at the medical museum in copenhagen at the medical museum , with a exhibition .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s mostly quite young people , but the only thing that unites you all , is these fascination with the technology .
and what you can do with it , and you can do it in a very way , and ask yourself , ok , what do you know what you want to do you , you have a interest in this ?
so , <unk> , to hack biology now , you need to have material .
you need to be biological materials , and you need tools , and then that &apos;s a lab .
and what you normally understand under a lab is that &apos;s sort of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely powerful , only for <unk> , trained academics , with a ph.d. and so on .
and our approach was to say , <unk> , that actually , you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary , because each one of the <unk> has actually has higher , it &apos;s actually developed , but most of the time , that &apos;s really like this .
and so , with this premise with this premise , brian <unk> , in england , he tried to <unk> a <unk> , then took a <unk> , and a <unk> , and , yes , so <unk> , and then it has been <unk> .
so everyone who &apos;s been a soup that has been down too long , it &apos;s done it .
so i &apos;ve tried this in my lab , a little bit , and then bought <unk> on ebay and bought a little bit of <unk> analysis , trying to make a <unk> , so a <unk> , <unk> home .
this shouldn &apos;t be a joke now , but it &apos;s not
and the the bottom down here in the picture is the lab , in <unk> , so that &apos;s a <unk> garage with so much that &apos;s <unk> , a group in paris , which has been set up and pretty successful with it , and pretty much doing it , and i want to make a project a little bit .
and this is <unk> , who also mentioned <unk> , this , , sort of , sort of a <unk> principle , basically for molecular biology .
and yeah , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so there &apos;s no way of people who do this in their own home , to the big organizations , that are already <unk> more <unk> in <unk> form .
but always the the point that it &apos;s going to be simple and accessible to
so the first project we did as international group , when we were aware of ourselves , <unk> , we now have a real scene , and we are online , and we &apos;re all the people who are running up and like this .
and then , from the <unk> <unk> website , founders , and said , we also have to meet , even , real meeting , and then two highlights , one in london , <unk> 10 , and shortly on in the <unk> , in san francisco .
and , there &apos;s also about , yes , <unk> , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to share ?
and what what are our values and what are our targets , our foundations ?
and then we have a <unk> <unk> .
it was quite intuitive , so everyone just got this kind of wishes , his and what it was going to move , then , .
and i thought , i think , a pretty good code .
and then , we don &apos;t do that , but that &apos;s what &apos;s , i think , has been <unk> , , people are quite confident that people are right there .
and we even tried to put it back into the world , but it &apos;s kind of not there .
so i think we &apos;re actually in the <unk> , even a step further than the world &apos;s academic .
so what projects we do now are doing this ?
a project i did with the <unk> in switzerland , was that we wanted to build a kind of optical trap or optical <unk> .
this is , if you focus a laser , in one in the room , you can capture little particles in the air or in the liquid and and then in the focus , so that &apos;s captured there , like this kind of a <unk> principle .
this really works , this is going to be in academic academic , and then we thought we would have , we might have taken a webcam , then we put a webcam , the <unk> , the lens , and then you have a microscope , that &apos;s about <unk> .
you see that down there .
and then we put a <unk> <unk> <unk> and the laser <unk> the laser , and then tries to focus on this camera .
and it didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it .
so another project that from from the french group of paris , that &apos;s what it &apos;s done , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and he &apos;s like , like , like this kind of <unk> , like this kind of thing , so he &apos;s got on <unk> , his his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he then built this this helmet , and he was in cooperation with the museum .
then , the visitors in the room were able to go on this chair , sit on this helmet .
and then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought , or as they thought , is then different lights in the room .
it was a pretty pretty high-risk project .
another thing from the united states , which has been to do with this <unk> , is the <unk> , which is the most <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , <unk> , cleaning , fragments , so you can see them visible .
so , if i do that , the <unk> on the scene , then go , get get some of the <unk> , and then they &apos;re doing this kind of reference , and then they can say , <unk> , this hair corresponds to this person , like this .
and the machines that make this kind of expensive that you &apos;re a very expensive one , which you buy commercially , the cheapest ones go to <unk> euro .
and this is not <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also much .
so this is just a application of a lot of the ones that you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve got two two <unk> <unk> and said , <unk> , we do do that , cheaper , and then open source , free , <unk> hardware , and that &apos;s the <unk> , and now they have actually taken that , and they &apos;re now the cheapest performance of these devices worldwide .
i think somehow that &apos;s so six dollars or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap yet , but it &apos;s definitely not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a framework where it &apos;s going to be clear .
so it &apos;s a very embarrassing hack in my opinion .
a project i started to do was build a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like this kind of <unk> , that <unk> roughly so far , two centimeters or something .
you put <unk> on <unk> , and then you put it into this <unk> , and then i shot it on the runway , and then i got it that way .
so the device you see there is not working .
but this is my prototype my prototype , but it looked kind of a kind of thing like this , on the <unk> , <unk> electronics , and it was <unk> , and it was the pressure too high , the thing was broken .
and then i took a <unk> and plugged it on .
a <unk> , if you do the full power of water , it &apos;s got enough pressure , so i think so 40 to <unk> bar , about it .
and then you can speed the particles very enough , and then they go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about 30 euros up or something like that , <unk> , so that &apos;s the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
so , this is the moment , the the <unk> of the scene , which is to increase this availability of technology and also increase the information and the <unk> , that more people can engage with it .
because , as the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have a little bit of it , and there &apos;s no way of getting a good idea .
because if you just read about it , from <unk> , that &apos;s not the same as if you &apos;ve ever done it or seen it .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and if you can also be able to make meaningful decisions in society , and want to make a decision , then you need to access access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it , and you have to understand it and understand it .
and then the <unk> <unk> under the <unk> open <unk> and citizen science .
so , as citizens are being brought into the situation , they have a <unk> of science .
and this is the <unk> from the <unk> .
these are the people who at least officially on the website , <unk> website .
it &apos;s a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also covering in southeast asia .
that &apos;s me think they &apos;re there there are fewer people than actually exist .
so i know of some of you who don &apos;t have up .
and these are just the <unk> , the individual people .
and partly , these <unk> , these places are put together .
and that &apos;s the very beginning .
and it &apos;s just been started .
and <unk> , the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and this is now a giant network of very good , yes , <unk> that are represented anywhere in the world .
and we hope that we will also take away from the same way , and then be equally connected , so that we can also get more people involved .
and i would invite everybody to engage with it and also try to do what they were .
it &apos;s not that simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , you get too far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we actually work people ?
this is a question that was very moving to me as a designer , but also in the realm of the <unk> and in front of all the things that i &apos;m talking about .
it &apos;s about how to put people in interactive media , so they can use this interactive media and create them a very <unk> experience .
and i believe that the interactive media in us , cognitive models , that we have in our biological memory , are very , very long , very long , and that we can just be able to create the <unk> of interactive media .
and that &apos;s very amazing , because you think that this <unk> that you actually get in the future , but actually it &apos;s actually the future that the future is right with us , in our <unk> roots .
so what are <unk> models ?
i &apos;ve got four <unk> , and i want to talk quickly about it .
so cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we &apos;ve been giving us in the pre-industrial times .
and to these <unk> models , we have a general natural relationship to the virtuality .
now that sounds unusual , apparently .
but i &apos;m going to go back to that , and i &apos;ll going to give you a try and prove that you have a natural relationship with the .
the second thing is that since because of this <unk> models , we &apos;ve been able to speak very , very carefully , even though we &apos;re using a <unk> language .
and the third one is actually explains about itself .
we all know that the interactive media by definition are <unk> , which includes the denial of linearity , and what we of course tell us is that we feel the the right now .
the fourth thing is that the story of us is a place of <unk> .
so what &apos;s the the relationship between the virtuality that is the most unfortunate thing in the world .
i want to prove to you this .
how many doors did the house that live in ?
we won &apos;t going to answer them that spontaneously , but it &apos;s going to happen and happen right now .
they go through the house through this house , in <unk> them , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
they <unk> the reality , and they &apos;re without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re trying to put in the virtual reality of the virtual reality in our <unk> , and we can actually do that all the time .
and that wealth of the virtual world , the virtual reality , that had had the people in the pre-industrial times , too , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they had no mass mass .
the only thing that had was her head .
and it was in this mind , remembered .
in this mind , knowledge has been <unk> and using these virtual pictures , the imagination , the imagination , has been been passed on .
and so it &apos;s so powerful to us that we can deal with the virtuality .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little trip .
yes , that &apos;s what .
and the interesting thing about this is that at the time , the man at the same time was <unk> and medium itself .
if you think about a piece of further .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s been change .
but i &apos;ll talk to that right now .
the real tools of the brain tools have been been <unk> .
<unk> , priests , so-called <unk> , were <unk> to be knowledge of knowledge .
and we &apos;re still hanging very , very strong on stories today .
author of the book of the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , who we still still a year of <unk> hours with the <unk> of stories .
that means a kid that has been doing it for the end of the time , the most of his life , has spent most of his life with the <unk> of stories .
now we think our love is stories on the time that we &apos;ve been on our parent &apos;s lap .
no , no , no , far .
this is going on much further , into the cultures of the pre-industrial age .
but to me , in the realm of interactive media as particularly impressive , we have <unk> in our biological memory , that we have the ability to think of ourselves .
i &apos;ve brought you an example of the northern forest of the pacific .
and they lived living in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you had to navigate there , from island to island to get food .
and they did this with so-called <unk> .
you may know that , if you &apos;re interested in this , of the australian indians .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have schedules , they they &apos;ve used the <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be mapped over songs .
and the language of language was <unk> by <unk> .
that means you &apos;re talking about sound and about rhythm .
and these sounds and these rhythm have the geology , and it also has the case that you could actually put these songs and put them together and put together different , and to left to the left , and again to the left .
why don &apos;t we sing more to come from a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what what &apos;s happening ?
this is what happens to that <unk> .
we &apos;ve been going to move on the so-called <unk> .
and what happened is that the machine and happened is the book and happened is the <unk> .
and that is what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and the <unk> of our individual memories , on external media .
on the book and the picture .
so unfortunately , god god , god , we have a bit of <unk> .
so virtuality has become alien to us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a well-known <unk> on the <unk> , is so far to say that this <unk> , he says the book , and the picture , so the the , the internet , and so on , as we call the media mass , that this mass mass of our memories has broken and our ability to <unk> our ability to <unk> .
let &apos;s do a little <unk> .
from the <unk> to the machine .
what influences the impact on our thinking and our <unk> ?
and then the <unk> <unk> of the pre-industrial cultures .
and they &apos;re going to be more and more <unk> over the centuries of the <unk> .
that is , instead of knowing how we can , we have plenty common , pervasive patterns of memories that we can hold our personal memories on .
we &apos;re not producing more ourselves .
we have a abstract language of language .
we don &apos;t put things in pictures anymore , and we don &apos;t put them in pictures anymore , but we <unk> them .
we &apos;ve used to that things happen linear .
and we have accepted the as a law , and there are only exceptions , like example , the <unk> .
what &apos;s remained us is the <unk> .
we &apos;re still the <unk> as a very , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s coming ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the machine machine , and we &apos;ve got this so-called <unk> .
this sounds very <unk> , and it sounds very simplistic , i know .
but these concepts of the brain system , which bring us to us back to rebuild these opportunities back to us .
it &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to explain this a little bit .
there are technical concepts like this , for example , the augmented reality , which is the extended reality .
so if you look at google <unk> for example , this is a concept that allows us to combine the virtual world with the real world , that means to <unk> our <unk> to feel the virtual , the virtual , is to be , again , to think about it .
another example is this so-called virtual reality .
so , of course , that &apos;s the kind of thing that i talk about , which is , we &apos;re moving to <unk> , virtual worlds , and the model of the <unk> .
and other other example are the <unk> , smart systems .
these are spaces that can react to a human .
all of this needs the ability to accept our fundamental ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i &apos;ve graduated in the , and i hope that the video , a very , very beautiful project brought up , this is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are here today .
you might have a little bit up , so you can get up with the two with the two of the two .
and i &apos;ve taken this project as an example , as again , again , again , this <unk> , cognitive models .
all of this is a game , i have to say .
which of course , what <unk> , of course , is extremely <unk> .
and when i say computer engineers , they &apos;re very likely to see that any people people people people who have some mescaline or or they play with them with any kind of <unk> .
so anyway , they &apos;re doing this in .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s what i thought i was seeing the outside world , so that i could choose the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce , the the real world .
i &apos;m so i have to be so strong .
you can explain that much better , because there &apos;s more lot more behind .
and this is because i &apos;m making a city , looking at what places are positive or negative .
and so i get from the city a whole different view , a whole different impression , which i see is negative and positive zones of a city and and i get a whole different , virtual map of a very real city .
and so we like to look at this now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you &apos;re seeing .
of course , this virtual world in the walls of our cities , yes , is clear .
and with a kind of flashlight , we can see these virtual worlds .
so , i like to wrap this up , my talk is , in the sense that the properties and the skills that we acquired from the <unk> <unk> and that we &apos;ve gone out of the <unk> , and that we can be more complex about complex , technological , new products , in fact , not in the future , but actually to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very , very pleased to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked to see if this bag is a <unk> bag and mine is going to be speaking .
it &apos;s not going to do it .
i &apos;m going to get out in the same way that &apos;s there .
but i &apos;ve just done it even more than a little bit of a .
yes , kids are inspired by nature , or should be curious , designers too .
i &apos;m a <unk> of the house , so i &apos;m also interested in the issue of curiosity and how the curiosity also , and why we might lose curiosity and why we might be <unk> and and and so on and so forth .
so this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re concerned with , in the actual way , as a design .
they &apos;re often curious to be curious about the <unk> of the .
and that &apos;s what i had over the last half of the year .
a <unk> of the subject of natural design .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why do all the <unk> are with such natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , interacting with things and so on .
and so , i just get one of these little devices , because things are always intuitive , more and more natural , more <unk> , and there &apos;s got to be , what is actually about for us , of course , what is <unk> or intuitively .
and before the background , i have a <unk> interface , which is the next generation in the training of the human being , so the next generation of human computer , in the way we &apos;re designing the computer , how how the computer computer computer is changing to the digital assistant to the digital assistant .
so i &apos;m busy with , of course , when is , of course , or intuitively .
maybe you have to look at it again .
why is it happening at all ?
so if we look at the evolution of our society , here &apos;s a second , we &apos;re moving from the third to the fourth century or or .
so from modern to the <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
so the beginning of the language , the language .
so , you &apos;ve found that you &apos;re talking to a common language , you could communicate with each other , you could put into the same cave or put it into other areas , or put towns or villages and have created it .
but the <unk> was , but it was a very natural , something very natural , a very living .
but you had to learn , no , no toddler can speak of nature , but we &apos;re learning about it and <unk> it .
and that was then transformed by ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
now , this was a <unk> , because , of course , the living language started to <unk> in the form of writing , which means what &apos;s going to be <unk> and alive , i &apos;m going to start and <unk> it in stone and and i &apos;ll do it .
as i &apos;m <unk> and when i <unk> , , of course , it &apos;s a very different way than if there is a alive of a living .
but then , <unk> , the <unk> , was <unk> , was getting .
then the next generation , where we actually actually live in most of life today .
this is actually the print and <unk> <unk> font with <unk> and others .
it was also a <unk> where , where <unk> , and others said , well , you &apos;re actually <unk> when the people start reading , then then afterwards , afterwards , they want to be <unk> , and that &apos;s completely <unk> .
and now we &apos;re coming to the next generation and and the exciting thing , a <unk> is just every few hundred years , and we &apos;re actually in this <unk> stage now that we &apos;re doing this .
the confused us of course , because we see on one side the new media , <unk> social media , facebook etc . , etc .
so with total transparency , which is the new thinking is what the old thinking is , what you think is the <unk> , not a beef , or any phenomena , and i want to do that just just <unk> and and want to <unk> it .
and these two worlds just pop up , new and old thinking .
and the exciting thing is , if you look at the <unk> , this new society , these <unk> , are very very many mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from from the <unk> .
but not more at local level , but on a global level .
we understood that weather is global .
that the issue of ecology is a global warming .
not when i think locally , and the neighbor thinks less organic , it doesn &apos;t work all the way .
that means that the local village is actually a global village , with the same principles , of course , intuitive , but also the total transparency .
like , in the village , who had known what and when , what happens to us , this is happening today , this <unk> of our selves through this mobile phone .
if we know global charge and we &apos;re getting more and faster and more and more and more .
just as it happened to the village , it was happening .
so before the background , i just started looking at what &apos;s called , what is it that we have , what &apos;s , what we might have , what &apos;s also for us , but what does the difference ?
because typically people come , you can &apos;t do it , so everyone can handle it .
so you have to engage with that , which means , and not just change it , but it &apos;s going to be different , but it should be better .
and when &apos;s a little intuitive , of course , and how can i take a sense of influence and design , so that they are so intuitive , so they &apos;re kind of fun , because then they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re just to use .
you &apos;re going to work , even during the , with the subject of perception and the <unk> .
and that &apos;s , of course , what you start and look and look , okay , ok , now i just look into the inner self .
and what &apos;s it that &apos;s out there ?
so how do we work when we get there ?
and what does it mean , of course , is , intuitively , how do our channels work the perception and how how the cognitive process works ?
because steve jobs used to say , you <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so you really need to look at the detail when i want to make something or intuit something , which is the core .
and what you see is that you have a of our seven senses , most of us think about five , now it &apos;s already seven times , there &apos;s certainly the next , the next , the <unk> of the , and as extension , again , our ourselves .
and to see how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is any difference that makes a difference .
many of the use , the word , don &apos;t know what it means to do .
but i have to understand the core , understanding the creature , when is information becomes information , and from information , information and information , i know how i know things like things like this , or , of course , can make things like this .
and of course , how does design influence the perception .
we see this here when i put things together , i can make them confusing , like on the right side , where i don &apos;t know , what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can actually make them intuitive , by showing things .
so , a lot of natural , , in a gourd , but i &apos;m sort of looking right there , where salt salt salt and pepper .
and when i tell someone , i &apos;ll give me salt or pepper , and then it will be at the right time , where is it in .
and then the left-hand thing , and then hopefully i &apos;m hoping that there &apos;s no sugar in it , that salt is just to the .
but even our perception itself , how do you accept it .
for example , this perception in the context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small , even though it &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s the same size , and yet our perception , depending on what context we &apos;re going to do .
anybody know what this is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should be working .
there &apos;s it going on to my glasses .
so it &apos;s &apos; n circle .
a second circle starts to be certain , or to demonstrate certain .
and if i take a <unk> <unk> , we don &apos;t just see a unit of oneness , which is circle , circle , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , another .
and that &apos;s what you call <unk> or <unk> <unk> , which is also affecting us in perception .
so for the headlines , the most <unk> , the most <unk> , the great <unk> .
<unk> that is close to the <unk> , the continuity and so on .
so often in the third , they &apos;ve forgotten .
but this is an essential important component , if you just want to design things to happen to happen .
the next phenomenon , which is also interesting , is the .
sounds quite trivial , but it &apos;s very exciting to get closer to it .
so we have the eyes on the front , and now you think , we &apos;re looking at the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see , again , backwards , backwards .
and she &apos;s <unk> a assumption , which is that you see something you know , <unk> circle .
that is , we &apos;re just seeing our seeing our we see it again , back in our <unk> , to say , okay , okay .
i have a cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what you want to see .
that &apos;s then , then , that &apos;s coming back .
and then it goes back , because the back doesn &apos;t tell you and says , well , please look like , if what you see is what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually just seen .
so , very , very conceptual process , just things things happen and what things happen for <unk> these things .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve described .
now , everybody out of this pattern is trying to see something .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
anybody see something specific ?
a <unk> , right .
once i saw this , that &apos;s a <unk> inside , you know .
you &apos;ll never forget it , because i show you where the <unk> is .
now look at the <unk> .
and on , and so , you see it .
that means i actually actually never <unk> them , that you don &apos;t recognize any patterns , but i &apos;ve got them <unk> in a very short time , and over and over again , see this dog in this <unk> picture .
and this is this projection of vision , <unk> ,
now i know , and now i &apos;m going to go forward , i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , very , very exciting processes , which then , in this , , it doesn &apos;t actually matter , but here in this <unk> crowd , just are just circuits .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as a designer .
if i know something , a little bit of a little bit of a , until i sort of get out of the present , i can also bridge very well in which i always do with three seconds .
it has to process it as a present .
and then it goes into the past , and so i can get a very elegant way of playing on the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what &apos;s <unk> milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
and , quite a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period period in love .
that means , if you know that , you can see what you &apos;re looking at , you &apos;re looking at how long because i don &apos;t have any <unk> for what can happen to happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period of most perceptions we have .
that means that this first impression is going on in a rapidly fast speed , how we perceive things .
and as we also see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re sort of <unk> against our environment , so we can think about it .
of course , the memory is not just dealing with the subject of perceptions and neural <unk> , but <unk> , but of course , with the subject of the <unk> .
so , how do a human being with certain things .
there &apos;s a <unk> of the practical functions , so <unk> things or <unk> things .
there are <unk> , where i know where i have to reach .
but there &apos;s symbolic functions , why does someone have a little <unk> , where anyway , so <unk> , so <unk> sums of money , so much money it &apos;s not so practical ?
and we &apos;re more like the <unk> , on the <unk> , which we also consider to be a <unk> of , as a <unk> .
back to my actual topic , natural user interface and the subject , which is , of course , is <unk> .
<unk> means , as i can , i can get a certain goal , or how can a user reach in a certain amount of diet , effectively effectively , efficiently and <unk> a destination .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s like to do .
how can i make something more <unk> ?
can i do this directly , or i need to do it , or i need a <unk> training for it .
and less <unk> or <unk> is it .
that i do that in different ways and make it beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you also have to understand that .
and then , if you look at the software that we &apos;ve seen , looking at it , you will also understand why <unk> percent of our today &apos;s software is not , or not <unk> , which is common to <unk> in many fields or <unk> , although it &apos;s a more intuitive thing than classical software .
and so hannah &apos;s not only a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> fair , if i want to make technology use to people .
why ?
because usually we &apos;re through this new kind of <unk> , which is the natural user interface , for example , five times faster in average , for example ,
you have to imagine that if you do something the classic <unk> , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , it &apos;s just an hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean you can probably go home four hours , but your employer or anyone will have to you , and you &apos;re going to do it with the four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> to make certain things .
so when we went back to the realm of software , here &apos;s the first <unk> of <unk> , which was very abstract , where needed months to deal with these systems .
and then the next thing that was already with &apos; <unk> neural model , or mental model like software , worked , , you have have a idea of something , the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer useful .
so no more zeros and ones or <unk> codes , but just a metaphor .
and it made it a lot of work , but it &apos;s actually going on , of course , much better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> has worked a lot more with behavior .
so i &apos;m going to invent as a lot more more than the behavior of the behavior .
it &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
i realized that this is always a <unk> for success , and it &apos;s a resolution that &apos;s going to be a app .
and if i step into a step into this natural of <unk> , where i &apos;m a voice , by language , by a language , by a gesture , and no longer having mouse and no longer to control things , i &apos;m still going to go faster and more .
but that leads me to the point , when does things get intuitive ?
if you get intuitive , and then i have to look back my little friend here and look at what does it mean from the <unk> , when is it really intuitively ?
and that &apos;s always a intuitive for us humans , if i have to think about it very little bit about it .
so he &apos;d like to think , he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that means , if you look at the existing capacities of one on something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can do it as a visual .
that means i can put a intuitive , human <unk> on software software and make software much more <unk> .
now , of course , the question is , what is actually so <unk> <unk> of us humans and now i &apos;ve got it to tell you ?
this is called the <unk> .
this is a <unk> of us and <unk> is a acronym , and it stands for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that makes everybody all the time , but it &apos;s kind of <unk> or <unk> , or <unk> .
the model is already <unk> in the womb , and it &apos;s <unk> , so it works in young and old , and it &apos;s used all the time without most most of the time that we knew that this model was present .
<unk> <unk> at the time , about 50 to <unk> , depending on us , so in the sleep , you have found that it &apos;s then less likely to be less than a day than it day .
i can now take this mental <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the <unk> , now no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of the <unk> than the transmission of an classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and if i &apos;m going to do this now , for example , when i &apos;m <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> as a choice , <unk> , the case , it comes up to me , and yes , <unk> , i can do it anywhere else or send someone or send someone or buy or buy or so on .
then i can translate the whole thing .
i &apos;m try this through a <unk> .
i mean , everybody had a cake .
dashboard : now i &apos;m actually using the object , again , <unk> , <unk> .
i &apos;ll get the whole tourist view , and can now filter up , and i can just show all the things with chocolate .
and once suddenly , a interface , which is much more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can reach things like the inch , <unk> , and they come to me , is essential more natural than if talking about <unk> organized websites or other mechanisms of ways can make these things accessible .
imagination is more subtle <unk> <unk> , and with this phrase , i also want to close and give you a a and give designers to think , also , designers need differently , and in that sense , i thank you very much for your attention and
i want to give you a very different aspect of curiosity .
the first one is when you &apos;re a child , as baby baby , is that they care about what they have , yes ? and depending on their parents have allowed them to play more or less in the <unk> , the more , , the more , of course , their curiosity will be bothered by it .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
so that &apos;s all of us who are here and curious , actually people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m about to try to make virtually all of this <unk> , <unk> , 40 years of <unk> , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and it depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
they give them a + every day , they give about two grams of phosphorus , and every day they have to pick two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bones .
we could only put as a <unk> through the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t actually expect phosphorus and give it a phosphorus .
but the thing is , we &apos;re dealing with something that &apos;s actually <unk> , but it &apos;s not that .
because all of the talk about energy , but nobody talks about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only been for two years , and now now , through the world &apos;s education , a lot more uranium in the world has taken into the environment than it is used in all the <unk> .
in the last few years alone , <unk> tons of uranium spilled in our fields in germany .
and we &apos;ll take that up .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , <unk> less car .
<unk> the environment , do less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
that &apos;s not protection .
it &apos;s like saying , i would say , your child , just blow it three times rather than five .
that &apos;s just a bit less destruction .
when we think about from from from the to the <unk> , our our entire earth will be or once again , a <unk> .
that &apos;s why the <unk> of the <unk> to the <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as the first .
over the ground , over 2.5 percent of the rainforest .
right now , we &apos;re building corn and losing about 11 and 30 tons of 30 tons per hectare , or <unk> .
that means we &apos;re losing about <unk> in the ground about five times more than we &apos;re going to be .
and course , we can look at the <unk> .
and everything is packaging or content .
for example , in <unk> , the <unk> , 20 percent of the world &apos;s <unk> has now been diapers .
and because we &apos;re older , the diapers are bigger .
that &apos;s you all all in the <unk> .
yes ?
a baby needs about six diapers .
we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is balanced in china in a second .
it &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go to these diapers ?
here &apos;s one of the evidence that men are not pigs pigs .
let me tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be the <unk> of the <unk> .
people are about urine .
yeah .
so , you can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s done with it , right ?
traditionally , we think in the <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you &apos;re the people who are <unk> people , if you say that &apos;s better , you would not be there , you &apos;ll be <unk> and <unk> .
and so someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , there is nothing more than the human population .
in israel , if you go to a human life , you have the earth .
here says , the more you get out , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at ants , the weight of the ants on the earth , then the ants weigh about four times more than we are .
i could take termites , but in the united states , nobody might like termites in the same way , even though they &apos;re vegetarians .
that means the ants weigh much more than we do .
and because they work much harder than we do , and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , a little bit of 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
and where you see how far we are away from what we really wanted to do and and how sad we are , that we &apos;re at the ground , you can see that , for example , there &apos;s a program , until 20 40 , you &apos;d be to be <unk> , right ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only chance .
have you seen a laminated tree ?
yes ?
one one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be a trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
for happiness , right ?
there is no <unk> of trees .
there are still six billion trees in the country alone .
you &apos;ve heard about trees from trees ?
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be a trees .
and where you can see , even at something like demeter , the <unk> <unk> , doesn &apos;t allow us to go back to our own <unk> .
every year , we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really ought to go back in space cycles .
and we &apos;re too many .
just on it .
that is , we feel so guilty on the earth that we say , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and as you all are called , our own <unk> will go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which is <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the highest thing is not to be there , right ?
<unk> , yes ?
they can only have <unk> if they &apos;re not there .
even if you were to shoot , you would have emissions .
so they can &apos;t fix that .
we can do it differently .
we can fix our nutrients .
we do in brazil in where we get the nutrients .
right , we can get nutrients in agriculture in this way .
we &apos;re going to do this in china , for example , where we &apos;re going to take the inside .
in china , a <unk> today is still <unk> , so , right ?
and in our western world we were always too stupid , we were our nutrients .
that means that the western westerners draws it from the city only has only been , but the farmers never put a little back .
it &apos;s why the cities had to grow more and more , because farmers would go into cities and and cities had to keep away from the cities .
that &apos;s why all western empires are always increases until they &apos;ve gone out of infrastructure and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china it was different .
you &apos;ve done <unk> civilization over five years because you &apos;ve always been able to get the nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat in china , you &apos;re expected to be the long as you &apos;re going to stay the toilet , until you &apos;re going to get the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> to go and take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat , not for the food .
that means you can see on the internet , you can get the nutrients .
that &apos;s really nice about it , if you do that , so agriculture power , on a hectare of land in the <unk> , in a hectare of <unk> , can charge a <unk> dollar , and the plant will pick up chickens and vegetables and fish and fish .
and the great thing is that the <unk> in the favelas are downwards by over over percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , be very little .
we can support them to be good .
that &apos;s natural , but the facilities are themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed to do that through design that a farmer can just hold them .
that means , the <unk> go back .
and none of these assets , we &apos;ve now built over <unk> over the last twenty years , none of these plants ever became <unk> .
they could easily be a liter of <unk> , and then the plant would be ruined over years .
not instead .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people , be very little .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to have phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want , it will be up , germany best best is all the benefit from all wastewater treatment in <unk> .
unfortunately , not in <unk> , but maybe you can help the <unk> for a little bit .
because the <unk> plant could best be the phosphorus .
and it has to back .
we see this is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s a lot to do .
we &apos;ve been working on the time for three years .
the dutch government has explained , they will be the first country in the world , what phosphorus emissions are .
but we need this overall .
you know , there are two countries that are controlling almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries that control 40 percent of the arable land .
and the oil is we can replace by other energy savings .
but you can &apos;t replace the phosphorus .
that &apos;s not about making the existing a little less bad , but it &apos;s about making a difference .
and it &apos;s primarily to ask what the right thing is .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in fact , in holland , of course , is easier because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if your wife is sad , if you have uv them , and you come from 50 degrees .
very inefficient .
but , very , very , right ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany eats about six <unk> in her life .
all right .
it &apos;s not clear accurate , scientifically , because we don &apos;t know how much carbon is going to do .
but a <unk> , even at this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but absolutely effective , right ?
all of the things that are beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , it &apos;s efficiency .
asking , what is the right thing ?
not to burn the <unk> a little bit better and to keep it in the <unk> , to lose all of the materials for behavioral energy , but first , first , how do you make energy loops ?
imagine mozart efficient efficient .
yes ?
when i go to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , &quot; huh ?
this is efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , you ?
yes ?
that is , everything that counts in life is not about saving , avoiding , reducing .
all the <unk> .
we tell people , oh yeah , you don &apos;t have a green food in the south .
no , the throw is exactly the right , right ?
in every place where you go out , you go from , you get again .
but the wrong stuff .
if you put the wrong stuff , you have a <unk> .
we &apos;re thinking about north .
there &apos;s any footprint in there .
if you walk , yes , every waste footprint is the floor .
because the soil is going to die , the mosses will die , and the wind and the water is running away .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water is longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a major footprint that becomes a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we say in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how do you tell you about her wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yeah ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so not saving , avoid , avoid .
every waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust when you see in italy , like people in high big bow , out of the car , to it .
because you know , it &apos;s a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a <unk> form of <unk> , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
we &apos;ve developed a <unk> , , which is in temperature temperature .
they can go and stand up where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re all building .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they &apos;re contributing through the grid to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful in it .
so it &apos;s two loops .
it &apos;s not all of course being <unk> .
a television or a washing machine , they use them , they don &apos;t use them .
just the things that are <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , that have to be so that they go into biological systems .
the things that are only used are going in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
directly direct ads , not for the company <unk> by se , but for that now they help this company to make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t make things freely from the .
yes ?
so if i &apos;m going to eat them out to lunch and say that &apos;s free of <unk> , it &apos;s not helping you .
no , we &apos;re stuck what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic in .
it &apos;s all in it , is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can can put the <unk> on the <unk> and go to the <unk> , right ?
everything of that is <unk> of it .
and if we do , of course , it &apos;s going to be us for <unk> , for nike , for nike and <unk> and all the textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the world &apos;s <unk> globally , which is caused by the textile industry .
so they help them , ask them , ask people .
hey , <unk> , do you really be serious ?
because they &apos;ve been able to have the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not sure that you really suck .
so , help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s .
yeah .
so , what &apos;s just been presented .
that &apos;s .
we can do things now , if they &apos;re <unk> , if they go down , they can put in biological loops .
technical loops are the same .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> of this .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , that &apos;s made for it , in the circulation .
so that , so in every shop , you can get things out .
if you come to this , right ?
remember the second time ?
if the right now is the waste .
all this <unk> is there , virtually .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s the <unk> , but it &apos;s in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics so it can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , inside , you can just back to the <unk> , then you can plant trees in israel or in tunisia , or in tunisia .
yes ?
and just if you take these these these , they &apos;re <unk> , sterilized and the powder to plant trees .
so that &apos;s the baby <unk> for the whole life , so it &apos;s beginning to start .
so , we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s kind of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah , so . .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything again .
i started building a institute to do this .
and so many people have working working there , and they can all engage .
there &apos;s a a group of people who can join , where everybody can join .
so no longer saving , consuming , preventing , reduce , not <unk> , but intelligent waste .
does it make that curious ?
thank you .
the work of the .
music as a language .
so , in the description of my talk , i &apos;m written as a <unk> , as a <unk> , so i &apos;m a <unk> , so in english english .
<unk> are the <unk> notes in <unk> music .
that as a <unk> , you don &apos;t just realize word word for a different language , but also the deeper sense of the words and the <unk> , so it makes a reasonable translation to know how anybody who has to do with <unk> .
translate from the german into english , more know , should require more knowledge , if it &apos;s about poetry or poetry .
but it &apos;s really alarming to what we &apos;re doing to do with our players .
as a <unk> of a 26-year-old , i just just the <unk> notes .
you think the composer has <unk> the <unk> all over the notes , what he dreamed of .
in fact , the grades are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are roughly as same or as <unk> as a verbal experience , if very seemingly <unk> , cartoon of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of flowers is not smell to smell the degree of <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , not to feel .
that means that the interpreter has to be the <unk> of the <unk> in another , which is a <unk> , concrete , measurable structural translation .
today i want to share with you the other thing that i otherwise translate in a verbal mind , a <unk> language .
so , basically a translation translation translation .
so i prefer to do this whole thing on german , because if i had to translate it to english , it would be an translation of translation translation translation translation .
so , the music , the music , is like the word language .
the <unk> notes have the function of a scripture .
so it &apos;s not to learn to read and read the keys on the piano or the right place on a <unk> .
because that &apos;s just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of the letters you can only see when you can the language .
so for the learning process of music , you need to be as long as the word language .
so there &apos;s also a lot of time that you learn to do it for the <unk> , or you can also get active , or you can talk to the musical speaker .
the work of the puzzle is similar to the <unk> of a <unk> .
so first first you &apos;re going to play a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re actually <unk> to the point of the composition of the composition .
you &apos;re collecting information over the piece in the <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts from the composers themselves .
you study the works that he was doing before and after .
you start to compare .
the <unk> to write it .
how and what did he do ?
what were his daily life , like society and politics ?
all of this interest .
you &apos;re thinking in this time , by example , by reading contemporary images or reading literature .
but as you have , you have a rich , you know , a rich , you know , the composers that you have to play more and and you can make it easier to feel and feel in it .
the composer is increasingly becoming more to friend of mine that you live with .
his behalf , writing the piece , will increasingly more and more to my personal desire to play it .
now , the notes is everything else as a <unk> record of the the of the composers , but just a framework , now i turn this scaffold to turn it back to meaning and meaning .
i say to my own words , what could be written between this framework ?
i &apos;m playing <unk> , which could have these notes .
now for me and for the composers back then , and what you might mean for him today .
every note , every phrase gets a sense , that i feel it , because it &apos;s from my now personal <unk> .
it has to be for me in the and now , and i can &apos;t convince my audience that that &apos;s my concern .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been so long in advance , i &apos;ve seen it .
so , as you &apos;re looking at a happy new day , even though with the same rituals of life , up , eating , to work , i &apos;ll also leave the same piece again and over again .
i &apos;ve grown up a day a day , changing seasons , my pulse is slowing down on the morning , in a <unk> , it takes longer than the sound back back to the home .
i &apos;m going to take the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
and all of this influenced me and all of this also , and the composition of the composition .
and wonderful is , if i stand on the stage with a <unk> , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in good good , <unk> conversation .
you bring a new idea in and you apply it to respond to a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting because then things that we don &apos;t have , and what you can &apos;t do .
it makes great fun to do music in this way , and then you &apos;ve seen the audience that music is alive .
so every concert is a other concert .
i will never play more as i &apos;m in that moment .
i can &apos;t play like this today in 20 years .
and i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and so i &apos;m going to rely on my palette of <unk> , more <unk> , emotion and emotion than today .
sure , i &apos;ll have some <unk> , but i &apos;ll have new <unk> .
have a nice example of this .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> in my beloved old teacher , professor <unk> <unk> , a well-known <unk> , <unk> , and radical professor of <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was too young to see that he was already <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i was very lucky to meet him very early , and to meet , and so i was already on my school on my school .
i was 17 years old when i was in one of his courses , played the last one of the four texts from chopin , a <unk> .
and he asked me what the introduction of these <unk> were for me .
this is a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said expectation .
he <unk> and said , &quot; so ?
this must be the <unk> .
because for me , it means memory .
he was about <unk> .
well , with 17 , you have even dreams , but no major memories .
i &apos;m playing this piece every couple of years now , and i always have it for me , although no one has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because again , i &apos;ll read something new .
an example of this , from a whole different . monet drew the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but it &apos;s also different <unk> , with light light .
he &apos;s translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw it , as she was at this moment .
his personal <unk> of the <unk> .
the signature interpretation of a piece is this comparable .
i &apos;ve been also older than a <unk> age when i was writing the piece .
he lived only only <unk> years .
and it &apos;s important to me to look back into the notes , even if i mean , to memorize them .
to keep <unk> , right right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him directly .
especially if he &apos;s already gone .
so , how do you start talking the language of music ?
i said , you know , you need about the same as the word for the word language .
and often the <unk> is , you know , you learn reading the notes .
you &apos;re probably learning to read this before you just just just one word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
if all the fingers in time and right as it &apos;s in the notes , it starts to sound out , then sounds sounds like music .
when that happens , the student gets the <unk> piece .
there &apos;s hardly a lot of description talking about .
all right , there &apos;s a <unk> on front of the front , that &apos;s a quick piece .
<unk> , slow .
according to <unk> , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s what most people know here .
but even if you plot these data , it still stays a technical technical .
and it &apos;s not a interpretation yet .
i wonder .
i wonder that often you &apos;re a little bit of <unk> .
that means , to make music on the instrument , your musical musical and feel should be there before .
that &apos;s where singing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn the singing , because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it won &apos;t do it by themselves .
this is like the <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have his own experiences and ideas of music to then then have to be more possible to make a sense of sound .
people who have never met , and they never felt <unk> their own body as it is to form a sound .
to make a phrase with his own breath .
because the music is the extension of our body .
our vocal , to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the <unk> of the piano is the sequel of my finger .
the tune comes from the <unk> and the rhythm from the dance .
the <unk> <unk> nowadays is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to do anything more yourself if it &apos;s boring .
no more needed to whistling a <unk> .
every own music is going to be <unk> when you &apos;re <unk> out the outside with music .
sure , there are some of you who say yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
i i ask you , can you sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
it &apos;s not too late to start to see if they can &apos;t do it , or learn how to do these little muscles that are <unk> the vocal chords , use the vocal chords .
because that can train train training .
or c , because you have <unk> them , they &apos;re <unk> .
so i wonder how profound competent is this diagnosis ?
have you ever been a <unk> or <unk> , how do you say it ?
or d , you like the <unk> , and you want to be doing with with it .
but what i would do is , because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can do it again .
well , you see , all cases , no one has to be a viable candidate .
but don &apos;t say please , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t tell whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i &apos;m , but surely you can tell you whether or not you like you or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says , &quot; i don &apos;t know if i can &apos;t , because i can &apos;t cook . &quot;
so , don &apos;t use to eat , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to dispense classical music , because they don &apos;t have instruments .
listen consciously and tell you whether it tastes or not .
whether the music is too selfish or too sweet .
tell you what you feel .
and you can also make more and more food , and you want to get some more food out there , or taste out fine .
so why am i going to listen from my audience now , that it &apos;s also active ?
because the music is a language and a language to communicate with it .
a piece of artwork that you never look at has no power to do .
the food that was hunted by a chef or a chef , has to eat and not just looked at or <unk> .
so please listen to the music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if you &apos;re in a environment where the adults are active music or hearing active music , a child grows , then it &apos;s easy for a <unk> to ask , what color does your flower have ?
can you play me in blue now ?
and the kid plays , after a <unk> , , instead of a red flower , a little flower .
and this sounds very different from the before .
and that was the first first beginning of a very musical expression .
so the first step to an interpretation .
and what happens if you play a piece today , which was originally written a hundred , before <unk> or even ago ,
now , the tools have begun to emerge .
there was no piano at the time as an instrument .
it wasn &apos;t really invented .
i think that was the stream that would have been the most important economic opportunity to have the modern economic development .
i can now bring the <unk> that the stream has been , in the modern wing , which a <unk> <unk> can &apos;t breathe .
and beethoven also knows that he was hearing more than he had become deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that a orchestra has dropped off at the time .
so the composers are on us on <unk> to reinventing the bits again .
so they &apos;re going to be <unk> , what they &apos;ve just found in the mind .
and also , what you would think in the mind today .
or what i &apos;m going to do today is because what you might have thought .
thank you .
do you know what envy is ?
were you once jealous ?
and how did that feel ?
<unk> .
i have a friend who drives a <unk> .
and when i come from , my little v w and i &apos;m going to get here , this feeling of it .
i get something through my head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need for n of the car ?
that &apos;s the first year of his <unk> .
and at all , you do a lot less than i do .
why do i have to do something like that ?
and then i immediately think , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling is gone .
our organism invented a great method to just get these <unk> feelings like the envy of the .
you can also try to say about words like revenge or <unk> or <unk> .
i want to explain to you today something about this mechanism , or something that is probably familiar with you .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but remember , not the lie , as you may have heard , when people say , nobody has to build a wall .
and then rocks <unk> , so he would give them the view of view .
on a lie like this , you can see the liar itself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s very easy to check that it &apos;s very different in the sense .
he &apos;s just <unk> them , not himself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about is doing to do with yourself .
you need this lie to get a <unk> to get a self-deception .
they can &apos;t make them a little bit , yes , <unk> , or <unk> .
they need time .
this time , an anecdote that you may know about .
spanish painter <unk> picasso once spoke a woman .
this woman was <unk> , and she didn &apos;t see see the portrait .
picasso &apos;s , wait for , wait .
it &apos;s always going to be you .
so at this point , and if you laugh , you realize how important this lie is and how much time you need to learn something that artists can tell us very well .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to lie .
the artist divides you something , and especially this lady , which she doesn &apos;t see if she just looks in the mirror .
the artist divides you in such a portrait that you &apos;re just going to be familiar with , and you can see this piece of work over and over again .
then this uncomfortable feeling disappears , it might not be you very much , and it &apos;s going to be you more .
here you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not only in art , in the <unk> , in the mythology , in stories , it puts back up .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked at mirror mirror every morning and asked him , who is the most beautiful all over the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
there are seven mountains behind the seven mountains and so forth .
and you know how much hostility from this true , is also not lying in the mirror , from this true <unk> .
but we should just make sure that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere else .
here &apos;s what we &apos;re doing under <unk> <unk> , again , in the <unk> .
we need this lie to this lie that <unk> us , which we can &apos;t even get .
we don &apos;t only have the art in art , in the <unk> , but also in science such great lie .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s <unk> of <unk> .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the origin of the species and the descent of man .
the human being should be <unk> from the monkey and , yes , there was a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her up to her husband and she said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not what charles &apos;s going to do .
the man &apos;s supposed to be from the monkey or a common ancestor .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent people &apos;s understanding of it .
why do we prevent people people to get out of something if it &apos;s true ?
because without those <unk> , we can &apos;t live without those .
because we &apos;re these <unk> , to be great , from the highest beings , not from one such thing , not a kind of <unk> mechanism , like a organism , which is still on a stone , and what things that are , for us , is <unk> .
so , we can &apos;t fix these things at all .
we need to prevent people from things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly these mechanisms are rising and what the traces that he leaves , which is going to something else than on this great image of ourselves , and i want to give you another story of the .
a particularly beautiful story , i &apos;m talking about .
my wife told her to me .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told her about a student .
a 16-year-old student .
she likes to love him because he &apos;s got a tendency to sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and there he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire brigade .
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yes , you feel it when you &apos;re in the spot , there &apos;s something wrong .
i said my wife , whenever a human being used in moral policy , is because we should try to replace it by replacing the <unk> .
and then do that , and then you get the sentence .
even though i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel , that &apos;s the real truth behind the .
that &apos;s a little <unk> , which is not interested in <unk> .
they &apos;re interested in <unk> .
but there are no clubs where we can look at where you learn to do fire .
there &apos;s only the second , just the firemen brigade .
he signed up .
and <unk> , you &apos;re not telling his teacher that you &apos;re like to put a <unk> somewhere , and you &apos;re happy to fire fire fire .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re wired to eliminate the risks that the risks that make the others only when they just lay fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this this <unk> , that the <unk> of the <unk> already knew that he was actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t tell it to .
here you have this <unk> between the unconscious and the conscious , right away , without doing something about it , and the things you know you look very different from , so that you can make a much better for you and others .
so just as we just put words that we &apos;re also using in the language of the political classroom always time .
we know , we know something else is the case .
but we know when we &apos;re the <unk> , the social manifestation are very sensitive to
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like this in a society that is supposed to work .
i &apos;d like to give you a little bit of what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
after what we have , these <unk> , these <unk> , the willingness , the other reality , is that we actually know in the <unk> that it &apos;s valid to spread out .
and i want to leave you with two , maybe three examples .
the first example requires what many of you know and some of you , just don &apos;t need to do all the time .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is kind of like <unk> , says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that is not <unk> , harmony is nature .
and if you have people who are the strong belief that they have a soul , or you have to say that they &apos;ve been locked by the soul , not from matter , they &apos;re just like a <unk> framework about them , not from matter , they kind of <unk> from the , , <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and so from that soul , she &apos;s thinking that somehow she &apos;s somehow in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , <unk> , it &apos;s in latin , the <unk> .
and then when this <unk> came to people , it &apos;s filled with spirit , with spirit , with nature that can only live , and it &apos;s with soul .
and then he can <unk> .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul is .
so it &apos;s supposed to be from the outside to the people .
so we &apos;re supposed to perceive them as something that is supposed to be present for our lives .
and if you have these assumption , you understand the logic that we experience this happiness through a lie to better world .
because now you can apply a <unk> .
you know , <unk> , you know from school .
now , this is a <unk> that tells us a logic .
this is the hardest part of my talk .
this is what you need to do , but also to lie .
because it &apos;s so impossible to lie that they can just apply these logic to
in this <unk> , three sentences are coming .
the first sentence is , <unk> claims , there is no soul .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> has right , it doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i was very suspicious of it here .
a third sentence that immediately suggests people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
they say who &apos;s not soul who is dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and here you are feeling it .
here &apos;s this logic coming in this , yes , in this <unk> talk talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logical .
because i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you about reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i have right , the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , the <unk> is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any point about what &apos;s true .
i can say anything .
but critically , if i have right , it &apos;s just true .
so when <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical .
and now our <unk> awareness is immediately , and we can do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that does pretend the opposite of the first sentence has already been and cared .
because actually , we would have to prove whether or not it &apos;s the soul .
but with this logic that &apos;s simply using two sentences , it &apos;s a third <unk> , and a third <unk> that looks like he &apos;s having something to do with it , we can save our <unk> .
so we &apos;re doing pretend it &apos;s like it &apos;s impossible to live a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can keep these things out of different examples .
so in the present , we have a very modern example , which keeps filling the <unk> .
this is what you need to do is another <unk> issue , a <unk> from philosophy .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with the 21st century .
there was a scholars who named johannes <unk> , and after this is named the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> that &apos;s made of pure nature .
it &apos;s not the soul .
this is a <unk> .
and if you put the exact right in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
so he &apos;s right right in the middle .
so this is the <unk> .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> solve each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
so just if you take another example , so if immediately you get the haystack larger , it doesn &apos;t need reason , and it &apos;s not something that you do .
automatically , he walks to the right thought .
so if you have this idea , you &apos;re somehow driven in nature , <unk> , of the larger piles that you immediately get to a immediately , and also you feel feel like there must be something like free will .
and if we &apos;re already in <unk> at the <unk> , i can remember the <unk> for cancer cancer .
there &apos;s a scholars who called wolf , and by him , sometimes you say , wolf <unk> , there is no <unk> .
now we can form the second sentence , and can say , when wolf &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have any <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now read almost daily in the daily daily , that we find in this third sentence .
it looks something like , who has no <unk> , can &apos;t be pulled for the actions and claims for responsibility , and therefore he &apos;s <unk> .
again , you have it again .
and actually , you &apos;d have to prove whether there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do so as the first sentence of <unk> wrong , as if you were to take the opposite of the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything , if you want to test yourself yourself and particularly if you want to make people happy , practice that <unk> to lie .
practice that , for example , if you meet a person who you can then say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , which is called .
you can &apos;t call it , you &apos;d have a little bit politically comfortable .
say there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately , you will one , which is , of course , these kinds of <unk> , you can &apos;t prove that .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy with that , they &apos;re not sure there &apos;s no <unk> , the man is really happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled .
because he led them to a <unk> , he didn &apos;t get himself to .
because actually , this person is not interested in proving .
it &apos;s just interested in himself to prove himself to prove to prove that there &apos;s a <unk> .
so , the kind of shift of the <unk> , you &apos;re going to experience the state of lie .
and once you have a way of feeling that <unk> in other people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy if they don &apos;t remember them in their own .
thank you for your attention .
yes , good afternoon .
i i asked myself to say , &quot; i &apos;ll tell you if i could mention it .
she &apos;s one of the great stories here , and i asked me if i would take a talk here and i would like my idea .
i have to say , you have it <unk> , i i initially felt hard to talk about my idea .
and i may think that i &apos;m going to think of myself as a storyteller .
but of course , it &apos;s all the sum , all of the ideas .
i guess the two nice girls are still there , i guess probably the generation that &apos;s been wrong for this bad <unk> image , because i &apos;ve already started studying engineers in <unk> , engineering , today , and i think it &apos;s a <unk> .
and then i was in berlin for the &apos; 80s , because i wanted to make renewables , and that didn &apos;t have that in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> were all <unk> , called the <unk> .
the hot ones today .
because a good engineer has either built great cars or <unk> .
but these like <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , from a hundred watts of watt , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy <unk> .
i &apos;m grateful grateful that he had the word again again , because after the <unk> , you didn &apos;t use the word anymore , because everything left left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that way in the 1950s .
it was , there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> , where you were evil .
place of the <unk> , but it was called <unk> and and made wind and solar power , and i started in the back of the 1980s .
and yes , a lot of what was said to me today , was very , because many , many beautiful expressions of the i &apos;ve been getting away .
i worked in the collective school , which was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
so , if one has no , the <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> . i &apos;ve got a <unk> for 10 years , i i &apos;ve got a <unk> on it , because i &apos;ve always got my father &apos;s house to come , you &apos;ve got the money on the window to your child .
it &apos;s busy with <unk> .
and it was really , very , very <unk> , and you can get into this <unk> stage , which was a picture on the <unk> , where i asked myself 10 years , <unk> , <unk> , in the collective , of course , whether it was really so great .
and then i went up to <unk> , and then we had a <unk> director of the company who then became <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of one of the world &apos;s largest microfinance companies .
a <unk> , but also there we again , the problem of growing , and we &apos;ve got <unk> , a small group , decided that we &apos;re getting small and and we &apos;re going to go back and think , and that &apos;s the same thing that people think , and that starts to say , &quot; well , we &apos;re talking about the <unk> , &quot; we &apos;re talking about store .
and i brought a project to bring you a project that i want to take you .
and the title of speech was , yes , how to get to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started to ask a very cosmological story about where could you be able to use a memory of a memory of a memory .
on this island , this is <unk> island <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there are a thousand people .
they have a <unk> <unk> of 15 percent today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
it &apos;s not just technological .
if you add more <unk> each other , the system starts failing .
i always tell this to politicians when they &apos;re in our facility .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
we &apos;ve got 20 percent in germany .
it &apos;s not a problem at all .
but right , we have seven percent in europe , and our net is the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we &apos;d have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , so that was <unk> , the first <unk> of the island , the the world , just like , would change the way .
how big it would be , because it &apos;s a battery that you could get a island like a , bananas , 30 , 50 , maybe , 70 percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go on again a <unk> .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , about a hundred <unk> of electrical power is <unk> on the world .
that &apos;s the <unk> of a hundred nuclear power , because it &apos;s very very quick .
the world &apos;s <unk> , which is happening , is deleted with diesel , because you don &apos;t need to have permission .
it &apos;s fast .
you can put it out of a box .
and then it looks like this .
in that , three of the <unk> , two will always wait .
yeah , this is what the load is down there .
we also have very detailed data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , is actually a <unk> system , which is a system that can only be typed into small amounts of
our goal was just to say , okay .
the diesel becomes <unk> and the wind , the sun is allowing you to map the wider percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the achievement at the moment , you have to turn off the diesel .
that means , at the moment , you have to make sure that renewables are going to be able to take the whole net .
of course , you can only do that , if you &apos;re in a way .
this is not what nobody did in the world .
so that &apos;s a small scale , so you can also use your car your car to your <unk> over a little <unk> .
people always ask me , what are you doing in <unk> ?
it &apos;s already .
but if you want to get multiple of these <unk> and you should build a net , it will extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to come to 70 percent renewable , and then there &apos;s this rest , the last rest , 20 percent renewable , which will be very , very expensive , and it won &apos;t work , you know , that &apos;s made of batteries .
it will be a <unk> case , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , or sh , it will be .
you then you have to go to a <unk> and <unk> and not just get <unk> .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s , with a normal , <unk> battery battery .
so how far do you get there ?
and then they &apos;ve made a whole bunch of simulation .
and they wind and sun and the sun and the <unk> came , and they came to the conclusion , a very interesting result , that after 20 years , a middle system of that , a middle quarter of a <unk> , , about 50 cents a gallon , about <unk> cents .
these were the first computations six years ago .
and then we said , okay , okay .
and &apos;s &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper than the average wage , if the average five percent goes up to five percent a year .
and then we started negotiating with the <unk> .
what would be done ?
i &apos;ve been to investors , i &apos;ve searched for new research .
we were only five people at the time to rebuild society .
and here &apos;s the picture again .
the brown is the the conventional system , the green system , the system .
that our system also has a <unk> , because we &apos;re still making 20 percent of diesel , and we don &apos;t have a <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> that which <unk> the <unk> on the island , it , we find that &apos;s pretty much .
but we want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we kind of , sort of , the electrical manifestation of the island of the scale of one to three .
so , we &apos;ve then sought to find the largest battery in the world .
here it is .
it &apos;s coming from asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> , she &apos;s in the &apos; 70s , <unk> , , now she &apos;s developed , and then she was <unk> to the japanese .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
it has a <unk> performance and it can bring that performance six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we sort of have <unk> .
and then they set them up .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size that it &apos;s up to the hall , actually , the full dynamic behavior of this web , so in the hall now it looks like this , the big battery is the , here &apos;s the whole <unk> that we &apos;re going to do with the grid .
over here , we &apos;re going to simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cables , to sort of reveal the <unk> web on the web .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> onto the net .
here we see this again again , again , again , again , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and what we did since <unk> was the hall , then , until now , everything was happening between the individual system in electronics , to build software , we did .
so we &apos;re not a <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company that &apos;s only between the issue and the issue and the issue and everything in between .
you have to be able to communicate , of course , to communicate , you have to communicate in the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is , in fact , that you &apos;re basically going to be able to do all that this island , all of the problems that we get , when we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , as it &apos;s going to go back and forth , and the , as we go , is , in the island , we have , for example , to 30 percent of <unk> , so we <unk> the wind and the sun .
<unk> then <unk> to <unk> .
so , <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can start to integrate on the island of <unk> , <unk> , you can manage to scale .
that means if you &apos;re at 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without the storage .
you can go through n , you can do it through <unk> of nets , yes , you should do it all the time , the percentage of <unk> , but you will never be able to use it on memory .
and that &apos;s the message of the message .
so , people get there , and they &apos;re looking at this , because you can see what the problems you get .
if we turn down the diesel , you don &apos;t have that kind of spinning mass that &apos;s caused a certain of the <unk> in the web .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically just <unk> of solid <unk> , where the wave is all around europe around europe .
we look in this web , see the 50 hertz , and when it gets <unk> , nine hertz , we &apos;ll start a few <unk> , then a little bit of <unk> steam in , then we get back .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , that &apos;s incredibly <unk> .
if you go into that somewhere , it &apos;s going to take a little bit .
the <unk> reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and over time , they can respond to another another .
if you haven &apos;t got that , this is the spinning mass , you have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can do two milliseconds at this big battery once .
there you go , there &apos;s a huge disconnect there .
and the message is , we need to get up to these stable masses , if we kind of have our targets , 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 , 30 percent and so on if we want to reach .
then we need to tear our <unk> capacity in the net .
and the <unk> is simple , the power station is running to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a <unk> moment right now , <unk> from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t have any , or <unk> , because it &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you can put the capacity that the <unk> capacity , the <unk> capacity , put it into the grid .
now , there &apos;s also a lot of studies now .
and then the people , people are always coming and looking at our <unk> , sort of , our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you go out there a a bit of the future ?
and many discussions that i had in the last six years were similar like the discussion i had in the last 30 years of <unk> .
don &apos;t go , <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;ve never figured out , never .
we have <unk> <unk> <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i just just going to think that in the next 30 years , we &apos;re going to store the same capacity of <unk> store all over the world .
it &apos;s just that it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s going to be a whole bunch of <unk> and arguments .
the nice thing is , i &apos;ve been experiencing now in the last two years , that scientists are asking themselves to my side .
we &apos;ve got over 10 million <unk> now , and we have <unk> <unk> now to the german grid .
this is going to be the next april .
so from that , you also see that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only from that <unk> , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far , in arguments , the <unk> trials , these <unk> , who are doing , they have a little net , they have nothing to do with our <unk> .
the question is , though , if you &apos;re totally independent from any fossil or <unk> <unk> , who are going to be <unk> anywhere in the world and become <unk> to them , then they &apos;re an island .
then they just use what &apos;s going on to the sun and the wind where they live .
and so this is a little bit of our vision from a <unk> energy policy , and i &apos;m also thankful that they &apos;ve said , use solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and we &apos;ve come to the talk , the talk of <unk> <unk> , that you can be a collective , you can be a collective , you can use a little bit of a <unk> .
and yeah , i just want to encourage you to be in the sense that you can be a little crazy and you can have a vision .
and you really have to be quite <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
when steve lopez , the l.a. times , the los angeles times , went through the middle of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless living on a violin that had two <unk> .
many of you will know the story , because from <unk> articles on this , later later , was a book that was <unk> , with robert <unk> and jamie <unk> as a nathaniel <unk> <unk> , the <unk> who studied the <unk> , and the promising career was early through his <unk> schizophrenia .
nathaniel left , juilliard , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived as a homeless player on the streets of los angeles at the center of los angeles .
i &apos;m going to tell you all the <unk> book or looking at the movie , so you can &apos;t just understand the wonderful interconnection that came out of these two men , but how the music was made that connection , and as it was finally , the instrument , when this pun is allowed to get the <unk> , nathaniel path from the street .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , the walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and i came up with the stage to imagine me .
he spoke in a very <unk> and <unk> note about yo-yo glory and hillary clinton and how the dodgers would never create into the baseball world , and that &apos;s all about the <unk> passage of the first violin in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we came to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email , which said that nathaniel was interested in <unk> for me .
i have to say that nathaniel had a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric and with <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that has been tracking him his whole life .
so as a result , it &apos;s very susceptible to these schizophrenic stages , and they &apos;re so bad , and he &apos;s going to go back to the streets of <unk> row , <unk> , that horror and the <unk> of his own mind .
and in just like this , nathaniel was himself , when we started our first <unk> in the walt disney hall , he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and he had lost his mind .
he was talking about invisible demons and smoke and and wanting to poison him in sleep .
i was scared not to be scared , not <unk> , but i was afraid that i could lose him in one of his states , and i could destroy him with the violin , when i started talking about the <unk> and the <unk> and other exciting forms of the <unk> .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in <unk> eyes , there was a complete change .
it was like being under the impact of a invisible , a chemical response , which catalyst my game was .
<unk> <unk> theories turned into understanding , in a calm curiosity and <unk> .
and as a miracle , he took his violin and started to play some <unk> of <unk> , and then asked me to play her , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and then started talking about music , starting from bach on beethoven , journal , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he had not only had a <unk> knowledge about music , but it was also with her a close personal relationship .
he spoke about her with a passion and a understanding that i would know from my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
by playing music and talking about music , the <unk> man , <unk> man who moved just from the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , excellent , <unk> musician .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
for nathaniel , music means music .
because the music allows him to express his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity into something real .
and so he <unk> his <unk> conditions .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
this is why we &apos;re music : so that we can do something that inside us , deep inside , deep inside , our emotions , through our artistic lens , can form through our creativity .
and the reality of this is that we all meet us , and moves , inspired and together us .
so what nathaniel did , and the music brought back to a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood him , who recognized his talent and <unk> him .
and i &apos;m always going to play with nathaniel music , whether in the walt disney <unk> hall or <unk> <unk> , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play a little that i stole the <unk> .
i hope you forgive me .
so i &apos;ve been a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first one , which was more like a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good consistency , <unk> , a new <unk> .
what a fish .
better , he was bred in <unk> after the supposedly highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel like you could sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty for several months .
and one day the head of the company called and asked if i could update a event about the sustainability of the farm .
and of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company that was trying to solve what this unimaginable problem was for our cooks . how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years we have the ocean of the <unk> as we &apos;ve been chasing bare .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tunas , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , they &apos;re collapsed .
there &apos;s almost no more left .
so , or evil , <unk> , <unk> , will be part of our future .
many more than that . <unk> stock the environment , most of you are , and you &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a <unk> of 15 to one .
that means that 15 pounds of <unk> is required to get a pounds of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
don &apos;t taste very well .
so here was finally a company that tried to make it right .
i wanted to build them .
i called the the <unk> of the <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s call it .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for the far outside the sea , that you don &apos;t flush the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we are so far out that waste is being thrown off by our fish . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
one is great .
&quot; <unk> to one ? what do you do ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; great , &quot; i said .
and that night i was in bed , and i thought , &quot; what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t stand up .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you know , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know it . he &apos;s going to ask him .
well , i &apos;m going to do with a couple of people in the company . nobody could give me an <unk> answer , until finally , i finally with the senior biologist .
let &apos;s also call it a .
&quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; what , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yeah , feathers , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; what percentage of the <unk> chicken chicken is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you know what is sustainable to feed chicken in fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i &apos;m <unk> from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s actually i &apos;m .
no , i actually got <unk> from this fish because , i swear to god , who &apos;s got fish after that conversation to chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of game .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you know the the better you know your fish , you love the fish the more .
i ate him first in a restaurant first in <unk> .
a <unk> journalist had talked about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s got us a <unk> .
he came up with the table with a light , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had <unk> him .
hold twice .
he was still terrified .
who can make a fish so well after he got <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . actually , he &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he doesn &apos;t eat the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way you and i can understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner .
it &apos;s near the <unk> of the river .
until the earth was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they were <unk> on what they basically were .
they did this by making the land .
they built this complicated episode of channels , and they put water out of the country and out into the river .
now , they couldn &apos;t make that , not economic .
and it was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds to be , what many birds are .
and so 1982 , a spanish company bought the country with green .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water .
they literally put the lever off .
instead of using water , they used the canals to <unk> water back .
they <unk> the channels .
it created a 11,000 acres of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and in the process , the <unk> and his company completely reverse .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
and you zoom out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is <unk> channels and these density , lush march .
i was there with <unk> at the time .
it &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a part &quot; an crocodile &quot; to kiss . &quot;
okay ? so we were and we were fighting around the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> to my knees , and <unk> in quiet in quiet .
here he &apos;s taking a rare <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here he is a pattern of concentrate that reminds him of the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> has spent most of its career in the <unk> national park in africa .
i asked him how to become a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i am an expert on relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and he gets into more of rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , so in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak , and i was <unk> , and i had the <unk> piece of fish that i had at the <unk> .
so i interrupted it . i said , &quot; <unk> , how do your fish tastes so well ? &quot;
he pointed on the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do your fish eat ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a lame system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the electric biomass , the phytoplankton , the zoo , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
the one farm that you don &apos;t feed your animals ?
and later on day i went driving <unk> <unk> , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so naturally , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
the moment a film was like a film director had a <unk> .
and we bow around the corner , and we offered the incredible sight , thousands and thousands of thousands of pinker <unk> , a literally pinker carpet as far as the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you feed your fish ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
well , last year , 600,000 birds last year , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s become the largest and most important private school system in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last thing you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not hard .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the the the the the the the the system the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s move it down . a farm that doesn &apos;t blow your animals and a farm that measures their success at the health of their predators .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , this <unk> of the <unk> should not even be there .
they breed in a city of 240 miles away , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
they fly 240 kilometers to the farm every morning .
and every night they fly 240 miles away every night .
they do this because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i had introduced a kind of <unk> on penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , do you fly 8,000 miles to the farm and fly them 240 miles back the night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i was quoted a song from whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , the delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like them <unk> . i don &apos;t like them .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i almost never get it .
and yet , when i tried them in this restaurant in <unk> , she didn &apos;t tasted anything to <unk> .
they liked sweet and they were like taking a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned that to <unk> and he <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin seems like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense , before something entry occurs in the body .
she &apos;s evolved over evolution in the <unk> of evolution . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t blow their fish , a farm that measures their success success success .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , he &apos;s got tremendous , because the water that comes through this farm is coming in from the river .
it &apos;s a river that causes all of these things that rivers that are now tend to lead to chemical pollutants , <unk> pollutants ,
and when it comes through the system , and that leaves is the water is clean than it &apos;s <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
not only is it a farm that doesn &apos;t break , not just a farm that measures its success at the health of its predators , but a farm that literally is a <unk> , and not just for those fish , but for you and me .
because when the water freezes off , it would blow in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and i should do it , because this kind of thing , like romantic always , is also <unk> .
you might say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future for good food , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , one in which food actually taste well .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re lover .
we love <unk> . we love small <unk> . we talk about regional food . we eat organic .
and if you claim that these are the things that the future good food is up to someone else , and say , &quot; hey , people , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how will you feed the world ? &quot;
shall i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we already produce enough calories to feed the world more than only .
a billion people are going to be starving today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t like that question because she &apos;s the logic of our <unk> for the last 50 years .
the grain of <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , <unk> of the earth , chicken in fish , and all the time has the agribusiness simply asked , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how terrible can that be ? &quot;
this was the cause . it was the <unk> . it was the business plan of the american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a map in <unk> , a map , the quickly <unk> capital of the , that makes it possible .
it &apos;s not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our energy system is threatened today , not because of <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through fertile land , not by pumps , but by fresh water , not by <unk> , but by forests , not by <unk> and nets , but through fish in the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look for the <unk> for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> in and it never has a good good for food .
instead , instead , we look at the ecological model .
this is that , in two billion years of <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
companies that are not worlds , they &apos;re , , the <unk> of <unk> , of <unk> , the <unk> , instead of just being , farmers who are not just established , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also experts for flavor .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be .
you know , it &apos;s right to me , because if that &apos;s the future good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to share one thing about this today , the sum of the data that we consume is greater than the sum of your parts , and instead of thinking about <unk> , i want you to think about information as we can use information so that patterns and we recognize that trends that otherwise may not be visible .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical <unk> of age .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter after a particular cause , say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes you feel .
and that &apos;s because in the <unk> here , people are most most violent and they &apos;re the most <unk> .
we can go further step further and see the data then , and see that there are cancer and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
now if we go further further and after age , we say 40 years or younger , we &apos;re actually going to see that accidents should be concerned about people .
and who &apos;s looking at is true with men .
so , you see that this is very much about the information and data in this way very much in a lively fashion .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not be the content for content ?
now , what we &apos;ve here is the <unk> of every single &quot; sport <unk> &quot; which has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can actually test it after my talk in your dorm room .
with <unk> , you can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a specific copy .
so when i look here , i see the athletes coming in this issue and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i click on this point where the <unk> is told in which lance armstrong would be mentioned .
now , if i want to get a <unk> of , i could think , &quot; well , what if i looked at everything with the subject ? &quot;
so i step back and i <unk> the lens .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea that if you look on this kind of information , you &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , bigger , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t just look or not just .
you do something that &apos;s a little different .
it &apos;s something between , and we think it &apos;s going to be used in the way information can be used .
so i want to take this idea a little bit further , something like a little bit of a little bit .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single <unk> and we reduce it on a little summary .
the summary contains a short display and a symbol of the area that you come from .
i just show the top 500 of the top 500 .
but even in this <unk> , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue .
well , after i &apos;ve chosen government , i know that the <unk> that most of the time that i meet most of the time are &quot; people &apos; <unk> . &quot;
this is really important because this is a realization that doesn &apos;t have in a single <unk> .
that &apos;s just when you go back and look at it .
and i can then look at a particular of these summaries , i can go to the subject of time , &quot; people , &quot; and all of them .
now , if i look at all these people , i know the majority of these are <unk> , some of them come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono also is a ted prize winner .
so we can jump through and look at all the ted prize winner .
you can see , we &apos;re surfing the web the first time it &apos;s actually a net , not just side page , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what else that might be a little surprise .
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s not a browser , but you can start websites -- and we bring these <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back to step , and jump directly to a specific <unk> .
and that &apos;s important because you just look through the <unk> in this way , that the whole <unk> can look at the same way in the same way .
so i can zoom in in my process in a particular frame of time .
here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration i &apos;ve kept up here .
and i can kind of have to see what i &apos;ve been looking at today , again .
and , if i go back and look at it all , i can put my back on my back , maybe after my <unk> , and here i looked for &apos; <unk> , or here to live labs .
and from here i can go to the site and call them back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , and it makes it larger than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in the world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the curse of the .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation and turn the internet on the head , so instead of going from one to the other , , can we start to go from many things to many things , and see patterns that otherwise would be stuck ?
if we can do this , then this <unk> will be <unk> , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge from that .
and if we know know , we can even draw <unk> from it .
so i &apos;ll hear with it , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> of science fiction .
in my school , i was driving school with the bus every day every day .
and my nose always stuck in a book , a <unk> , which my thoughts in other worlds , and in a <unk> way , my deep <unk> , <unk> curiosity .
this curiosity also turned that if i wasn &apos;t in school , i was walking through the forests , <unk> and &quot; specimens &quot; &quot; and frogs and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and looking under the microscope .
i was completely <unk> , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the limits of the possible .
and my love to science fiction seemed to be in my environment , because then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and and we explored the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came up with our living rooms with his fascinating shows that reveal us and places and places of wonder that we never could have imagined before .
so , that &apos;s what i think is all of this <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since there was no video games , nor the <unk> movies , the whole imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the pictures in my head .
we had to do that at the time . when we were reading a book , we took the description of the gradient and put them on our heads .
my reaction to that was draw and draw by aliens , alien worlds , robots , <unk> and all that .
in the <unk> , i was constantly caught by the teacher , i &apos;m hidden , hidden in the west .
creativity had to be kind of out .
and something interesting happened , which was what i was doing to jacques <unk> shows was the thought of one of us completely unknown world on our earth itself .
certainly i would never have to get a alien world with a spaceship . it seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world i could actually enter here on the earth , and she was just as fascinating and exotic as all the things that i had ever imagined when i read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 , i was going to become divers .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 kilometers from the nearest ocean .
and i didn &apos;t let myself down .
i <unk> my father , until finally finally made a <unk> in buffalo , new york , who had made it , right on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got to face two years later when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , that are now <unk> , i &apos;ve spent about three hours of water , and 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the ocean , is so rich in the ocean , as we can really imagine , much of ourselves .
nature &apos;s imagination doesn &apos;t know borders , contrary to our own , <unk> human imagination .
up until today , i feel terrible awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean is holding the same intensity as ever and ever .
when i was an adult , the was a <unk> , and it was the filmmaking .
this seemed the best way to make my inner desire to share stories with my need , to unite images .
as a child , i drew comic books and the way .
so movies were the way to put pictures and stories , and they fit together .
of course , the stories i met , the <unk> : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i could put my <unk> for the <unk> and connect that diving with the filmmaking .
so , basically my two passions .
something interesting happened to &quot; <unk> &quot; : to solve a <unk> problem in this movie -- and we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- we <unk> , <unk> animation , <unk> animation .
and what came out was the first <unk> <unk> ever ever seen in a movie .
now , the film didn &apos;t give money , and he was just saying his own , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience in the world was <unk> from the magic that came out of it .
according arthur clarke &apos;s law , we &apos;re known to be <unk> technology and magic .
so they saw something magical .
and that &apos;s what i found incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that must be be involved in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator two , &quot; my next film , even further .
and together with <unk> , we created the guys out of liquid metal , and success was on the way that this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we created something magic , and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we &apos;ve done a little bit more money with the movie already .
from these two experiences , a whole new world was reached , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , with my good friend , stan winston , who was the best <unk> and <unk> , and she was called digital <unk> .
the idea of this company was to skip the phase of analog processes with visual printers and and start with digital <unk> .
we did that , and we <unk> a a a while of a while .
but the middle of the 1990s , we realized that we were actually in the <unk> and <unk> -- which we actually started to create the company -- to slow down .
i had written this piece called avatar , which the <unk> would be the the <unk> of visual effects and <unk> effects in all new altitudes , with the human human , expressive characters that had been made by <unk> , and the <unk> should be <unk> . and the world should be <unk> .
but the bar would make me a bit , and the people in my company said me that we were not able to do this .
so i just waited this , and i made this other thing about the big ship that goes out .
the <unk> , i sold this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship , &quot; a <unk> <unk> , a fiery movie .
but secretly , i wanted to go to the real wreck of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i thought , you know , by saying , &quot; we dip into the wreckage . we &apos;re going to see the real <unk> .
we will show it in the <unk> of the movie .
that &apos;s tremendously important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this is going to go back to that your imagination can create a reality .
we actually created a reality in six months later , where i was in a russian russian <unk> , four miles below the surface of the north pole , and i was looking at the real titanic through a <unk> .
it wasn &apos;t a movie , it wasn &apos;t a movie , it was real .
so , that really pissed me out .
and the excitement to that was enormous . we had to do cameras and air bulb and all kinds of things .
and i noticed how much these <unk> , a <unk> .
well , they were <unk> and <unk> more sophisticated planning .
you go into this capsule , then you go down into this dark , <unk> environment where there &apos;s no hope for saving , if you don &apos;t get it back .
and i was thinking , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was actually obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , from the part that you could do with curiosity-driven and science , it was all . it was all . it was curiosity , it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood could not give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then create a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see outside of the .
some of the following expeditions i &apos;ve seen in <unk> , and sometimes things i had never seen before , things that no one had ever seen before , and the science at all time , and the science at the time , had found it , no words .
so that &apos;s really me really , and i wanted to .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic &quot; i said to myself , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood and i &apos;ll <unk> for a while . &quot;
and then we started to the <unk> , and we started to do it with <unk> .
we returned to the cover of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which had a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was to look at the <unk> and look at the inside of the cycle , which was never been done before .
no one had explored the inner of the <unk> . you didn &apos;t have any means for it . so we evolved the technology .
so , sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> that &apos;s kind of like the <unk> here , and i know that once i know that the band has played there .
and i fly with a little tour of the <unk> of the ship .
i &apos;m just going to be it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was suspended inside the titanic of the titanic .
this was the most devastating form of a <unk> i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i left a corner , i always knew what was going on in the plane &apos;s <unk> , because i was left months of <unk> when we gave the film .
because , the set was a precise copy of the design of the ship .
so that was a very strange experience .
she made this observation that you could use such a <unk> , and so you could use your own consciousness into the vehicle , in that other form of existence .
it was really tremendously .
and maybe a little peek on what might happen in a few decades , if you have <unk> to explore or explore something other , in all kinds of <unk> that i can imagine as a <unk> .
and after these expeditions , we started to appreciate what we saw underneath , really appreciate , for example , where these <unk> , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , but this is a alien , but here on earth .
they live with <unk> .
they exist not in one of the sunlight that we do , the way we do that .
and this is how you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees c , that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was very interested in <unk> , which was the <unk> of my childhood .
and so i ended up doing the space and doing that with nasa and sitting in the <unk> and sitting in the <unk> , and they go to russia , and they go to russia , and they &apos;re going to the mission of <unk> <unk> , and then they go to international <unk> and take our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but it ended up going to go out to the deep sea , and i was going to take a <unk> with us .
i took them with them and i smelled at them at the world down : <unk> , <unk> , people who are interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to the sources , so they look at them , take samples and use instruments and and so on .
we did not know , we did science , but actually science , <unk> .
so the circle between my existence , as a child , was a child , and the execution was in reality .
i &apos;ve learned a lot during the voyage of this voyage .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m now thinking you &apos;re sure a director must lead to a leader , a leader , like a <unk> or something .
i don &apos;t mind much of leadership before i put this <unk> .
because at a point , i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s it coming out ? &quot;
these <unk> movies don &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;re just playing the <unk> , and it &apos;s not a <unk> .
everybody thinks i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and &quot; i &apos;d have the nails on a screen on the beach .
i &apos;ve made all these movies , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no glory , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re going to do it for the challenge to challenge the challenge -- and the ocean is the most hostile environment that you are , and it &apos;s because of the <unk> connection that arises , and because of the weird connection that comes up when a small group of people are creating a team .
because we &apos;ve done all of these with only 10 to 12 people who have done for years , and sometimes we were two to three months ago on lake .
and in this community you realize that the most important thing is that you &apos;re in front of each other , because you have a job that you can &apos;t explain otherwise .
when you come back and say , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the whole technique , the human <unk> , if you work on sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain it . it &apos;s like police officers or soldiers who have gone through the police party or or they know that they can never explain anyone .
there &apos;s a connection , a <unk> respect .
so when i came back to turn my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i was trying to use the same thing , which is to be respected and earned in the respect of the respect .
it really changed the dynamic .
so i stood back with a little team of <unk> terrain , and we were <unk> &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technique that didn &apos;t have before .
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were going to be a <unk> for a four and a half years .
it changed changed my way of making films completely .
there were people who thought we had really <unk> this <unk> and <unk> the planet .
for me , it was more a more difficult way to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we close from all of this ?
what lessons we learned ?
i think , first of all , it &apos;s curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the team of team is more important than all the world &apos;s <unk> .
to me , i get young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice of how i can do something . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t even intervene yourself .
this is going to be you . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t check yourself against yourself . take risks for you . &quot;
nasa has a <unk> : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art and in the process , failure needs to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a <unk> .
not important , the innovation demanded , the innovation was ever given without risk .
you have to be ready to take these risks .
that &apos;s the idea i &apos;d like to give you on , and failure is quite an alternative , fear , but it &apos;s not a . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and perhaps perhaps surprising , because my business business at the foundation is about vaccines and seeds to make the things that we need to invent and deliver the poorest two billion more lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually , more important than any other on the planet .
what &apos;s means is that their <unk> are not growing over many years , and they &apos;re too much , and they &apos;re going to change too much , things will change their own environment .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to turbulence .
so , an climate change will be terrible for you .
furthermore , the <unk> is very important for them .
the fact is that if you could reduce the price of the price , the energy would be far at far the most effective .
well , the <unk> is like the time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> were <unk> the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the <unk> , and so we have refrigerators , air conditioning , we can create modern materials and so many things .
so we are in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut down the price -- we &apos;ll come to a new barrier and that barrier is associated with co2 .
co2 warms on the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they <unk> the <unk> carbon , which leads to the <unk> , and this <unk> has some very negative consequences , effects on weather and perhaps worse , the <unk> result that the natural ecosystems cannot adapt such rapid changes and make all systems .
now , the exact relationship between a <unk> and and that &apos;s <unk> and where you are , there are some <unk> , but there &apos;s a few of them , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly certain that of how bad they are going to follow , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i asked the <unk> times , &quot; do we really need to go down near zero ?
do not not half the or a quarter ? &quot;
and the answer is , until we get close zero , the temperature will go further .
so that &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say we have a <unk> truck that has to be under a <unk> bridge , then you can go back and forth .
this has to go down to zero .
well , we &apos;re running a lot of <unk> every year , over 26 billion tons .
every americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
it &apos;s about five tons for each on the planet .
and somehow we have to produce changes that will down to zero .
it &apos;s been up in the far time .
only different economic changes have changed it at all , and we need to go from <unk> increases to reducing and to reduce and reduce to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little brain skill . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- you want to get zero , and that &apos;s going to be used by the number of people , the coffee that every person is contributing to every person , the average energy for every service and the co2 per unit per unit .
so let &apos;s take a single factor of it , and let &apos;s think about how we get that up zero .
probably one of those numbers must to come very close to zero .
now that &apos;s basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
we first have the population .
today , <unk> billion people .
and it &apos;s on nine billion <unk> that are moving on nine billion .
if we can do very successfully with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> , we might probably reduce it by 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope around 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this is all , the food we eat , clothing , heat , heat .
these are very good things and <unk> , to make these services accessible to everyone on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to make <unk> and less use , but in average , that number will going to grow every year and so more than doubled , the number of services that per person per person .
here &apos;s a very basic service . there &apos;s a light in the home , so that you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
well , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of different successes in the brain , through other diseases of the , through new ways of <unk> , there are many services that are taking some of the energy for 90 percent .
in other services , like the manufacturing of <unk> , 105 dollars : <unk> : <unk> -- &amp; amp ; / <unk> ; &amp; amp ; d : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> , the the store of improvement is much smaller .
of all , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get an reduction by one factor three or maybe even a factor of six .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re gone from 26 billion to 13 billion tons of <unk> , and that &apos;s not enough .
so let &apos;s take a look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 per unit of energy per unit .
it &apos;s a question of whether you can get that out to zero .
if you burn coal , you &apos;re no .
if you burn gas , you &apos;re not .
almost every single gasoline source for electricity today , co2 , renewables , renewables .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the term &quot; wonders , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and its service is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
there &apos;s no claim that you have a miracle to a certain date .
normally , you just get off and some , you don &apos;t .
but in this case , we have to give <unk> and a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i really translate this ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that &apos;s really inviting people &apos;s imaginations here ?
i remembered that last year when i was getting mosquitos , and i kind of liked it .
the idea was really , really tangible , you know , there are people who live with mosquitoes .
and for energy , i noticed this .
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies will be my <unk> contribution to the environment here .
so here are some natural fireflies .
i &apos;m told you &apos;re not bite . actually , you won &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like this , but they don &apos;t bring much lot .
we need solutions , either one or several of us have an incredible scaling and unimaginable twists , and even though there are many directions that people are looking for , i really see five who can afford these big demands .
i have a tides , <unk> , fusion and biofuels .
maybe these may a <unk> contribution , and if you do better than i do , that &apos;s be great , but my message here is that we have to work on all of those five , and we can &apos;t give up of them because they all have significant problems .
first , let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , burning of either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there seems to be simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to have to take all the co2 from the <unk> , , put it under pressure , and then you get under pressure and hoping that there &apos;s no .
there are some <unk> that are going to do that on 60 percent -- 80 percent of the level , but getting it to 100 percent , and it &apos;s going to be very difficult for understanding co2 , but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who will make it safe ?
who can guarantee something that literally can be a lot of billions of things that are more than any kind of waste you can imagine of <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough thing .
next : <unk> .
it &apos;s got three big problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries , are high , and the question of security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human confidence that the fuel isn &apos;t used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the trash ?
because it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that may be soluble and you should work on .
the last three of the five i put in .
it &apos;s renewables as often as they &apos;re called .
and even though they -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
one is the root that makes these technologies dramatically lower than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about lots of <unk> , 1,000 times more surface than a normal power station .
also , these sources are <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to be the whole day , and it doesn &apos;t seem to be the wind , and the wind doesn &apos;t always go .
so you have to get away from these sources , you have to get away from the sources , the energy in times when it &apos;s not available .
so there &apos;s big <unk> here . there are challenges at the transmission . and if we say that the energy is the country is , they don &apos;t need to have the technology , they need to deal with the risk of the energy from where they come from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve looked at all kinds of batteries that are made , look at cars , computers , mobile phones , <unk> , and i found that there &apos;s a lot of the <unk> that the world uses , and i found that all batteries that we produce now , we could be less than 10 minutes of the <unk> .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be 100 100 times better than the approaches at the time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you try to get these <unk> sources of the way to say that we have 20 percent of the planet &apos;s <unk> .
if you want to <unk> around 100 percent , you need an incredible amount of education .
so , what should we go to : what is the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; how do we get to the target ?
what we need is a lot of companies that work on this . hundreds of .
in each one of those five areas , we need at least 100 people .
you &apos;ll say , you &apos;re crazy . they &apos;re good .
i think there are many people in the ted group already there .
bill gross has several companies , including one called the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies making great things and interesting opportunities , and i try to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i &apos;m funding a company that &apos;s , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry a some time ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts are lying on .
the the <unk> means that instead of blowing a part of the <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , they had thought about it for a long time , but you could never have reasonable simulate if it was going to work , but since there &apos;s modern , you can simulate it and see that , yes , with the right <unk> , it looks like it &apos;s happening .
and because you burn the 99 percent of the time , the average is a lot better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of today as a <unk> .
so instead of breaking the head , they &apos;re just burning it . a great thing .
the uranium is being tracked , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that there &apos;s a kind of a column , often as &quot; traveling wave reactor . &quot;
it really solves the .
here &apos;s an image of a place in kentucky .
that &apos;s waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned up today , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
the <unk> the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re cheap cheaply , you &apos;re just getting enough propellant , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s many challenges , but there &apos;s an example of many of many of the ideas that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
now , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to reach , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many talk about 80 percent reduction in 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still in a , and hopefully , is going to be clean and and , and then it &apos;s clean to clean .
so to reach this 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , their <unk> .
the other note is whether we &apos;re using the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s in all developed developed countries and we &apos;re gone away to get them to the rest of it .
that &apos;s great .
this is going to be an element of this .
if we go back , what &apos;s the end of the oil ?
it should be the two elements again .
we should use the <unk> to get reducing reducing , the less we <unk> , the less we will be , the less likely the <unk> and the temperature will be .
but actually , this note is the things that we do not have to do not completely the big <unk> , just the same , or even something less important than the other that the speed of innovation for this breakthroughs .
and we have to go through this breakthroughs , and we can measure that , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books on this subject .
al gore &apos;s book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
they really go through and make a framework where this can be discussing broad , because we need support of all sides .
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very similar wish we invent this technology .
if you just me for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love , or i could choose that wish , which is , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , will take this wish .
that &apos;s the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the tunnel is going to be terrible between the long and the <unk> , people are being terrible between the u.s. and china , between the poor and the wealthy and almost all of the lives of these two billion are going to be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what kind of thing do i do ?
we need to be involved in more business research .
if countries are together in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
you should be discussing these <unk> , and they would be shocked by the silly little funds that are going to be spent for these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade action , creating something that creates a <unk> .
we need to spread the message .
we need to take dialogue and collections and collections and also the things that are being undertaken by government government .
it &apos;s a very important wish , but i think we can make it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to get a little bit better -- you can , can you give us a idea of scale of the investment ?
bill gates : to get the simulation on a supercomputer , get all the scientists scientists , we &apos;ve done , we need only 10 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure it &apos;s reasonable , it &apos;s just in the <unk> million .
the difficult step is to build the first <unk> , to find more billion , the <unk> and the place that actually built the first of it .
once the first thing is , when it &apos;s as <unk> as promised , it &apos;s all right , because the <unk> , the energy is so different from the as we know it .
to understand that correctly , this means to be deep into the ground , like a vertical column of nuclear power , that <unk> <unk> , and then the process starts up and then goes on ?
<unk> : right . now you have to reset the reactor , so there &apos;s lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong . this thing , you open it up and <unk> things , or <unk> . it &apos;s not good .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can take it for 60 years -- think about a column that it buried , without the whole complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and burns 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> , which gives a solution to the trash .
<unk> : yeah . now what happens to the waste is you can let it -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- you can take it and put it in the next reactor and put it on .
and we start by taking the garbage that already exists in these <unk> or <unk> in the reactors . that &apos;s our <unk> .
so what this is a problem for this reactors is what we put in our camps , and it will dramatically reduce the <unk> process during this process .
but as you talk to various people of the world about these opportunities .
where &apos;s the biggest interest in this , what really really ?
<unk> : now we haven &apos;t set up a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting <unk> for everything the nuclear sauce is wearing . there &apos;s big interest and people of the company in russia , india , china -- i was here , and i talked about how this fits to the <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have made something to do .
this is a nuance of one thing that was made .
this is a big step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries built these , so anyone who &apos;s done a fast reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination : <unk> , and probability of that really , really ?
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to use .
that &apos;s kind of the chemical that we have to show the <unk> that we need to take .
and , you know , if all &apos;s good , it &apos;s a big wish , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could be easy .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of people , who are working on the way that they work in the service that works for their pilots .
and it would be best if it &apos;s a number of people , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
so , the great breakthroughs , this is the biggest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
that would have been without the <unk> , but it &apos;s still so much more important .
there are other innovative companies in the nuclear sector .
you know , we don &apos;t know of the work as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular method , that &apos;s another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> , which seems to be a little difficult , but maybe it &apos;s about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the nice thing is that a <unk> has a million times as much energy as a , say , a <unk> and therefore , the radiation , the power and the cost , is the the potential , the power , the cost of the , the the , the the , and other things , almost in a light league .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we need to switch online <unk> to try and maintain the <unk> ?
<unk> : when you get into this situation , it &apos;s like you ate too much , and you &apos;re just in front of an heart attack , and what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or something like that .
there &apos;s a p.r. called <unk> , which is dealing with various techniques to delay the warming , so we can get 20 or 30 years to get us back .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t work at all the insurance because maybe you might get it , you keep eating because you know that you &apos;re going to save the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you take the importance of this problem , but now there &apos;s a discourse in <unk> about whether you have to have it , if things need faster , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
<unk> : did you have one or two sentences for you to maybe convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics are in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there &apos;s negative effects that have to do with the clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things you can actually tell , which is a chance to be a million .
the <unk> here is like the equivalent of aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and so the idea now , if you have all kinds of problems in investing in something you &apos;ve just later -- and it &apos;s that the investment is not necessarily the worst , and there &apos;s people in the rich world not necessarily the worst , and there are people in the rich world watching ipcc and saying , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that these uncertainty should be concerned about us .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the skeptics says , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not sure that it doesn &apos;t matter , i wish it &apos;s not , but i &apos;ll probably accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the <unk> argument that , if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 , all the other targets , the <unk> , the <unk> of malaria , and so on that there &apos;s a dumb waste of resources to invest money in while there are better things we can do .
<unk> : well , the actual spending of the research -- let &apos;s say that u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than you do today -- it &apos;s not that dramatic .
there &apos;s no other things to suffer from .
you come to a big <unk> , and here &apos;s reasonable people disagree with if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and it &apos;s trying to fund that , and for me , most of the waste is .
it &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very short from a <unk> and funding , and i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much more valuable .
if you have the <unk> that you get , a very high <unk> , then only the rich ones can keep up .
i mean , we could spend five times as much for our energy without changing your lifestyle .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> thinks about .
so his new <unk> is , &quot; why isn &apos;t we going to talk about ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be because of his former stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and therefore he &apos;s going to get the <unk> .
and this is a translator that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little that is being backed up .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all the people here , i really hope that their wish is true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter <unk> wrote a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is quite simple . <unk> need to be the highest <unk> structure with 20 spaghetti ants , about four and a half square , about a meter and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must be on top of it .
and , even though it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s really hard to do because people are starting to work very fast .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , innovators and architects , even with the <unk> of the <unk> , and there &apos;s something about this task , which enables deep impressions to nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them with you .
normally , most people start to orient themselves to the task .
you talk about it , you think about what it looks like , she &apos;s going to look for power .
then they &apos;re investing a little time in planning and organization , and they &apos;re drawing and they &apos;re putting spaghetti .
they spend a lot of their time in the <unk> constantly constantly structures .
and finally , before you don &apos;t have time , someone will take the marshmallow and you put it gently down the top , step back and &quot; <unk> , &quot; they admire their work .
but what &apos;s happening , almost always happened , the &quot; <unk> &quot; is going to be a &quot; <unk> , &quot; because the weight of the <unk> is going to bend and <unk> .
there &apos;s a number of people who have much more &quot; <unk> than others , and under the worst , fresh arrangements are fresh .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused , and they produce really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more &quot; <unk> &quot; and under the best , fresh alumni of the <unk> .
and that &apos;s quite amazing .
as peter told us peter did not just make the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking is : how does this happen ? why ? what about those ?
and peter told , &quot; none of the children spend time in the leader of the spaghetti sauce . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that <unk> were trained to find a right plan , ok !
and then it &apos;s to realize him .
what happens when they put the marshmallow on the top , they don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what <unk> do is they start building the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow , so they have the ability to repair <unk> prototypes .
and <unk> , this kind of collaboration is the core of a <unk> <unk> .
and with every try , the kids get immediate feedback , and what they don &apos;t .
so , the power of working with prototypes , far -- but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
the average average for most of them is about <unk> , <unk> , half of them , lawyers are doing something more , but not much , more powerful than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
<unk> is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are key to build stable structures .
ceos are about average . but here it &apos;s going to be interesting .
if you put an <unk> administrator on the team , you &apos;ll get significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is this ?
because they have special skills of the .
they conduct the process , they understand it .
and the team that <unk> and the work is going to improve dramatically performance performance .
specialized skills and <unk> and and their combination lead to success .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about 6 , you have about six .
i tried to try something exciting .
i thought , let &apos;s bring the <unk> the the .
so i offered a $ <unk> award for the winner .
what did you think happened to these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had a high high construction , it would have carried the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high school levels have a strong effect ?
we <unk> this exercise with the same students .
what do you think happened ?
now they understood the benefit of the new .
so this is the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the slightest time .
so there &apos;s <unk> lessons for us , about nature of drive and success .
so you might ask , why would somebody actually invest time to create a feasibility factory ?
the reason is , i &apos;m using digital tools and processes to help teams , help cars , video games and video games .
and what the <unk> is , it helps them identify <unk> assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge provides a common experience , a common language , a <unk> , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in , can go to the <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
they find crazy examples from all around the world , how people change the system and <unk> .
there &apos;s also <unk> .
and the most interesting lesson i think is actually the construction is actually a sport sport .
it requires that we all all our senses to the task and that we &apos;re thinking optimal , we think , our emotions and our actions , in the challenge that lies ahead of us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is anything it takes to bring us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to get a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so &apos;s pretend we have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that &apos;s a machine machine .
and everyone in this room has to be inside .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose because i &apos;ve asked my friends recently that question , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america seeking the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe that you &apos;re kind of drawn to the <unk> , to <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go to the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a dreamer .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the most amazing time that ever existed on this planet , no matter what scale they were doing : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining <unk> .
there was never been a time like this .
my <unk> died when they were 60 .
my grandparents were preparing this number on <unk> .
my parents are the 80 to the <unk> .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that &apos;s born today in new delhi is expected to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve shaped the demographics in the way the world &apos;s been in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have them <unk> . <unk> .
in the rich world , diseases that millions of us have just a generation of us , hardly have yet ,
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
anybody know what it is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method of trying to try things , look if it &apos;s working , change it if it doesn &apos;t , one of the great achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , this is the whole good news , because there are some other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people hungry in this world every day .
this number goes up , and it &apos;s getting very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve been using our imagination to <unk> the world .
drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and soon , and if we don &apos;t get out of this mess , we &apos;ll be disappearing .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country that they live in .
i think we can power that world with energy that doesn &apos;t do at the same time .
i think that &apos;s really , and no , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is holding me awake at night -- one of the things that wake me awake at night , we &apos;ve never had the progress that we &apos;ve never had before , never .
and we &apos;ve never been able to make it sensible , as we can .
we are at the threshold of amazing , amazing events on many fields , and yet i really think that we would have to go back to the enlightenment 300 years to find progress in which we have progress in these things more <unk> , more than now , more <unk> than now .
people people in their faith , and so tightly , they can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth will free you .
and hear , everyone has a right to his opinion ; even a right to his opinion ,
but you know what they &apos;re not right ?
they don &apos;t have a right to their own facts . &apos; <unk> , they don &apos;t have it .
and i took a while to find this .
i wrote a article about the of the new yorker , about a new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed to be on resistance , to resistance , to what &apos;s most effective in the health care system in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote a paper and i continued .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about climate change .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i wrote written a paper about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that was &quot; <unk> , &quot; why you believed that molecules to a certain kind of collapse , a random kind of <unk> to the field of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re rich , we &apos;re eating , that &apos;s okay .
but i was worried about this article , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it .
and that &apos;s because these <unk> that were me nuts were not <unk> at all .
these were well-meaning people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and so that got me so much ...
but then i thought , you know what , are we honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to .
we talk about it .
we &apos;re talking ironic about this , with little quotes , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , so there are reasons , and i think we know what reason that &apos;s are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , there &apos;s no reason why it should not be that way .
you can just call some names and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your list .
there are questions and problems with the people we believed that they were always right . so they were skeptical .
ask asking , ask what evidence , demand for evidence .
don &apos;t take anything like granted .
but now comes is : if you have to get evidence evidence , you have to accept that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can say that because we now in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that the <unk> with the measles , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine .
very scary .
and in fact , a lot of studies were done to see if that was true .
so , a lot of studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all alike , no correlation , no association , no .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in anecdotes , we think what we see unlocks what makes us feel really feel ourselves .
we don &apos;t believe in a sack of documents from a <unk> that gives us data , and i understand that , i think , we all .
but you know what ?
the result of that was catastrophic .
in the case of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the <unk> is down for measles .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what &apos;s happened is we could do this .
well , i understand that . i do that .
because has anybody here ?
does one one in the audience ever discriminated to die ?
it &apos;s not often happening .
this is what happens in the country at all , but 160,000 times in the world last year .
this is a lot of deaths by measles , 20 20 an hour .
but because this is not happened , we can displace it , and people like jenny can walk around and <unk> and <unk> of <unk> like oprah and larry king live .
and they can do that because they &apos;re not connecting cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never are the same .
and this is something we need to learn , and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of mankind .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t do so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s just developed a <unk> with a couple of other people .
it can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
it &apos;s pretty good , right ?
now , that &apos;s good , except that paul talks and talks about vaccines and tells how valuable they are , and that people should stop <unk> .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul talks to a public policy , he can &apos;t tell you without <unk> .
he gets calls at home , because people like to tell him that they know where their kids go to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that say , but vaccines are essential .
you take them , you go back to the terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening right now .
we have now measles in this country .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon , kids will die again because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just dying .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a <unk> of mine wrote me a couple of weeks ago , and i said they &apos;re a little bit skeptical .
nobody one told that before .
she wouldn &apos;t be <unk> her child against <unk> . no .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a <unk> , and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have a <unk> in this country yesterday .
now , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning , somebody in lagos , sitting in a plane and flies straight to los angeles , right now , he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he &apos;s up and a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these <unk> <unk> tonight tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a disease disease , and we don &apos;t know either , because that &apos;s how the world is going .
that &apos;s the planet we live on . don &apos;t pretend that it &apos;s not .
we love to lie in lie . we love that .
you all taken your vitamins this morning ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that helps you to join the table .
i know you &apos;ve done this because half the americans do this every day .
they take this stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data is all the time .
they &apos;re making their urine . more of them do .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;m totally agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the power industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . so we we &apos;re not going to be our healthcare system .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing and <unk> itself to us that can afford to .
so we go away from that , and where are we going ?
we &apos;re running into the arms of the <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , it &apos;s really serious serious thing , because this stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of little props here .
none of them -- <unk> , fraud , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what this is , but we spend billions of dollars doing it .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scream at me and say , &quot; what &apos;s it care of ? let people do what they want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;ve wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t care that it &apos;s the <unk> , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to do the evidence of my experts in mammography , &quot; or any <unk> who who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you go to this path where belief and magic is replacing and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 his people because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are much more efficient than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can be <unk> the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of deaths in a country , the worse than any other one of this disease will be <unk> .
don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
well , the epidemic epidemic that we &apos;re in the field is that this is a <unk> struggle between the <unk> genetically food foods and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
all we eat , every single day , every branch , every single branch , was changed by the people .
you know , there were no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there were no <unk> . we did it all .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of that works , and some of them don &apos;t .
we &apos;ve got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more well , and of course there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a. in rice , and that stuff can help millions of people to extend their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re re-engineering the food that we have .
why do we do that ?
well , what i hear is all the time : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing , which is wrong .
we don &apos;t want firms patent life .
we don &apos;t want firms to have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all of this is ?
yes , they right . fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
it &apos;s nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it &apos;s and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we have a real <unk> , and it &apos;s holding millions of people from the flourish .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than currently , 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
they need this , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? prejudice altered food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff , like cassava .
cassava is something that eats half a billion people .
it &apos;s about a potato .
it &apos;s just a few calories . it &apos;s a little bit of a .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are building all this in in it .
and then people could be the and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be nice .
and all i can say to this is , why do we fight this ?
i mean , we &apos;re asking , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want genes to go through ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our <unk> on larger food , better food , excessive food .
it &apos;s not about <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to get time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so far on the way we do , we &apos;re guilty of something that we don &apos;t want to be guilty , that &apos;s high-tech .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our , and we really need to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; are you still going to go into this ridiculous machine and go into the future ? &quot;
definitely anyway . i want to do that .
now , at the moment , they are in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can do this machine machine on everything we want .
we can <unk> them , where we want them to go , and we will move them where we want .
we have to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time we go into the machine and go to the future we &apos;re going to be happy to have this .
i know that we can do it , and as far as it is to me , it &apos;s something that needs the world now .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the <unk> . it seems seem strange to be a magician might seem interested in the way that a magician is interested in , as i think , as &quot; a deception that will be to something rather than someone believes it &apos;s not . &quot;
in other words , <unk> have been shown a measurable effect in some studies , the <unk> , and that &apos;s because the person thinks about what happens to you , a <unk> or a kind of ... in the patient &apos;s only <unk> , if the patient is only holding it , a measurable effect in the body called the <unk> .
a deception becomes something because somebody makes it like this .
so to take the other hand , let me show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has been on at least in the 1950s in every given moment for children .
i myself learned him from the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;ll do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , see what happens .
the knife that you can study , my hand that you can study .
i &apos;m just going to put the knife in my head .
i get my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve is coming out of my sleeve , i just just get my wrist right here .
and so you can see that no one &apos;s going to move anything , and i can &apos;t get anything to go in my sleeve , i can &apos;t get out of my sleeve .
and the goal is that &apos;s very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully all of the sudden , the knife will <unk> through my naked physical magnetism .
it actually &apos;s actually stuck in its place that i can shake it without the knife of <unk> .
nothing moves in my sleeve or comes out , no <unk> , and you can study everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick i often often teach kids about the magic , which is magic , because you can learn a lot about deception in terms of being more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
many of you probably know this trick in the room .
it works the way .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i &apos;m saying that i &apos;m putting my wrist , i make sure that nothing in my sleeve or comes out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i put my wrist out is that the actual secret of illusion is the .
because , in the moment i put my hand away from you so that that finger is moving , this <unk> , my <unk> , just from where he was , in a position that he was so <unk> .
great trick ?
there &apos;s a guy sitting in the back who didn &apos;t have childhood .
so he &apos;s there . right .
and when i move away , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there &apos;s only three fingers down here , because the mind and the way that it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three , but it sees it as a group .
but that &apos;s not what it &apos;s about , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s going to be there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , which is now .
and when i close my hand , the same thing is , i get <unk> , is that the fingers will <unk> itself .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can show you your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what has this have to do with the iranian-american syndrome ?
a year ago or so , i read a study that really really really really really mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why i was an amazing thing .
because this is what it &apos;s like , if you &apos;re a dummy placebo in a white pill , in the form of a <unk> , that &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a particular measurable effect .
but if you shape the shape in which you put the dummy , for example , to a smaller pill , and you can see these blue and and a letter on it , it actually turns into measurably more effectively .
and that &apos;s despite any of them -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really made me freak out .
but it turns out that this is not all .
if you take capsules , they &apos;re more effective than any of the form .
a colored capsule that &apos;s yellow and the other side is the same , is better than a white capsule .
the tutoring plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the accurate statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is , you know ...
... and the <unk> is a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to get the ultimate <unk> , you have to reach to the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you injected in a patient .
this creates a very powerful picture in the head . that &apos;s a lot stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time if we have a projector .
so , in fact , the white pill doesn &apos;t seem as good as the blue pill , which doesn &apos;t seem as good as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of that has any really sophisticated property , and it &apos;s just our belief that we have a stronger effect in
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for an magic trick .
i &apos;m going to take something that is obviously a deception , and let &apos;s make it look real .
we know from that study that you need to reach to the needle when it &apos;s to go to the thing .
this is a <unk> long arc , it &apos;s very , very <unk> . and i &apos;m going to do a little bit of a little bit of a .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a <unk> of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin and make them go through them , until they &apos;re back on the other side .
if you were evil -- if you fall out of it -- i was a couple friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and there &apos;s a woman almost drawn .
so i propose that if you &apos;re going to get a little bit of evil , you &apos;ll look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know , i &apos;m going to make the first <unk> part here in the back .
you can see it in the same , but you can also <unk> if you want .
so , it goes , right here , where my flesh starts , the bottom part of my arm , i &apos;ll just make a little <unk> .
really sorry . does it mind crazy ?
and just a little bit of through my skin and on the other side , that &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had at the <unk> .
about .
but now , you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and <unk> itself to be the skin just to entertain us for a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show you .
what is this ? it looks pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people would say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;
people in the <unk> are now in .
so let me show you close .
this is really my skin . this is not a <unk> of hollywood .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can do it .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re evil , look away , don &apos;t look at it .
the people , or the ones that later see this on a video , they say , &quot; well , it looks pretty impressive , but if it &apos;s real , you would -- look -- you see , there &apos;s a hole and there if it was really real , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me just give you a little blood for you .
yes , it &apos;s .
i would usually take the needle now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no lesions .
but i think in this framework here , and i &apos;m going to make a really real thing out of deception , i &apos;m just going to let the needle in there and go off the stage .
we &apos;re going to face a couple more days in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re excited about that . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i &apos;ve done some number of people counting the number of books that were published in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and they had a lot more .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make happier .
but despite all these glut of working , there are several cognitive traps that are kind of impossible to make , which is to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly by the cognitive decline .
that is true of <unk> that think about your own happiness , and it &apos;s for scientists thinking about happiness , because it feels that we are just as mess as everybody else .
the first of those traps is a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that the word simply isn &apos;t useful useful word because we &apos;re using it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain sense that we might be able to share it , but in the big , and the whole thing is , we need to be <unk> , and we will have to adopt the complicated view of what &apos;s well-being .
the second case is a <unk> of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between happy to be between your life and happy your life or your happy life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a more that affects well-being without the meaning of the .
i mean , this is an actual cognitive case .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i would like to start with an example of someone who had a <unk> , a of mine , who wrote a story , and unclear ... &#93; he said he heard a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and at the end of the recording there was a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then he added a , really quite emotional , that &apos;s ruined all the experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of music music .
they didn &apos;t do because he was with memory , and memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep .
what really tells us is that we might think about ourselves and over other people in the sense of two ways of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present and the present , and the present is able to experience the past , but basically only the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self , the doctor <unk> -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; do you hurt if i &apos;m going to put you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the self itself is that that &apos;s <unk> and the story of our lives , and it &apos;s the one who appeals to the doctor by asking the question , &quot; how have you felt lately ? &quot;
or , &quot; how about your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and the two to be part of the <unk> of the happiness of happiness .
well , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a basic response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re telling ourselves stories .
our memory tells stories , which means what we can retain from our troops is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who are doing a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to be able to do it . it &apos;s not painful today , but it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who of them have suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has suffered more . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a had patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much thought these patients are they illness ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient had a a much lower <unk> on the <unk> , and the patient b.
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very significant part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is clear worse than the other .
and the worse is the worse is where the pain was at the end of its peak , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people who were asking them , and also , much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a b to a b in the <unk> .
well , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from the point of view itself , b had clearly a bad time .
well , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it could actually work the <unk> of the patient a <unk> by simply putting the tube in it without too much .
that &apos;s going to lead the patient , but only a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve made that the <unk> self is a a bad one , and you &apos;ve got that the <unk> self is a much better off of patient , because now you have a better story about your experience .
what &apos;s a story ?
and that &apos;s true of the stories that memory is us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent .
that &apos;s a story of a story of <unk> , major engagement and ends .
end is very , very important , and in this case , the end of the end .
well , the <unk> self lives his life .
it has the other day of the <unk> , one after another .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most of our lives -- and i &apos;ve done this -- you know , the psychological present is about about three seconds , what does , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them , and in a month , there &apos;s about 600,000 . most of you don &apos;t leave a trail .
most of you are completely ignored by the <unk> self .
and yet , you get the impression that you should count that what &apos;s happening in the process of the <unk> is our life is happening .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use as we are in the world .
and as we use it , it seems to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the <unk> itself for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the time .
from the point of view , if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first , then the <unk> vacation is twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
that &apos;s not what it works at all the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself , a <unk> vacation is barely better than the <unk> vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , the critical variable is actually a <unk> self , a <unk> self , and time has very little influence on this story .
well , the <unk> self is making more than to remember and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the fact that decisions are true because if you have a patient who &apos;s , we &apos;d two two <unk> at two different surgeons and decides what he should choose , that is the one who has the memory , which is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s chosen .
the <unk> self has no voice in that choice .
we don &apos;t actually choose between the <unk> , we choose to choose the memories of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t normally think of our future as we do experience .
we think about our future as a <unk> memories .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the self , and you can think of the <unk> itself as one , which is kind of a <unk> self , by experiences that doesn &apos;t need the <unk> itself .
i have the impression that if we do holiday that is very often the case , which means we &apos;re going to put vacation in the service of the <unk> self .
and that &apos;s a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we go from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that is given to the dominance of the .
and when i think about it , i think of a holiday that we &apos;ve done in antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best holiday i &apos;ve ever had , and i think relatively often , in proportion to how often i think of other memorials .
and i probably have my memories on this fuzzy journey , i would say , about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the dodo folder with the 600 images , i would have spent another hour .
now , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s a a a a half a half .
there seems to be an disagreement .
well , i may be a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the <unk> of memories , but even if you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why are we so much of the memories of the weight of the weight we &apos;re blogging ?
so i want you to think about an thought .
imagine your next vacation , you know that at the end of the screen , all of your images will be wiped out , and you get a <unk> drug so you don &apos;t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you &apos;re going to choose a different holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two types of self and you have to think about how you choose this conflict , and that &apos;s not quite obvious at all , because if you think about time , you get an answer , and if you think about memories , you might think of another answer .
so why we pick the <unk> that we choose is a problem that we choose to do with the two types of self .
now , the two types of self , two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can deploy , one of them .
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the life of the <unk> itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for ambiguity is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the <unk> self over time .
if you ask the <unk> of the <unk> yourself , it &apos;s a very different thing .
that &apos;s not what happy a person is .
it &apos;s about the , like happy or happy the person if this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
and who &apos;s not unlike that is being <unk> the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m a lot of researchers on well-being that have been studying the exploration of happiness long period of time .
the distinction between the happiness of the self and the happiness of the self itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two <unk> .
the gallup organization has a worldwide survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve been beginning to learn about the two kinds of the .
and the main lesson that we think i learned is that they really are different .
you know , how happy someone is with his life , and that &apos;s not teaches much about how happy he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about <unk> .
what what that means is that if you were somebody , and you would tell them , oh , dad is a <unk> , how much would you know about his greatness ?
well , you &apos;d know something about his size , but there &apos;s plenty lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone has a life on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is with their <unk> .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what the happiness of the <unk> is .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know happiness is basically to be satisfied with people we like , time to spend with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s the most dangerous thing .
so if you want to maximize the two types of the self , you will end up doing very different things at the end .
so , the conclusion that i &apos;ve said here is that we should really not imagine happiness as a replacement for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very quickly , another reason we can &apos;t really think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life , and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california are not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask this question , you think people have to be happy to be happy , if you say , in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , climate .
well , it turns out climate is not very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the <unk> itself is responsible , they can end up with -- some people could end up to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track what happens to people who are going to get to california , in hope .
well , your own health care is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;re going to remember how terrible the weather in ohio was , and you &apos;ll feel that you made the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you .
now , when we sent the phone a couple weeks ago , it was a very interesting conclusion that came out of this gallup survey .
is this something you can tell us about because you have a couple of minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting result we found in the gallup survey is a number that we absolutely couldn &apos;t have to find .
we found this in terms of the happiness of the .
if we look at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out , under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a great representative sample , under a revenue of 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are unhappy , and they become increasingly unhappy , the worse they will .
we get a absolutely flat line about that .
i mean , i rarely saw the flat lines .
what happens is , obviously , money doesn &apos;t take a <unk> , but that lack of money is a certainly <unk> , and we can measure this misery very , very clearly .
in the sense of the other self , the <unk> self , you get another story .
the more money you make the the more you &apos;re .
it &apos;s not true for emotion .
but danny , all of american commitment is life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to be on the head , everything we think is about <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that the country generally generally take a <unk> like the serious , and to make politics based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition is going to be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s happening , and in other countries , it &apos;s happening .
people are at the point of thinking about happiness when they think about politics .
it will take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to explore <unk> or or whether they want to explore <unk> , so we have to have this discussion quite soon .
how you can raise happiness , very different depending on how you think and whether you think about the <unk> yourself , or whether you think about the <unk> yourself .
that &apos;s going to influence politics , i think , in the years .
in the united states , you &apos;re looking at measuring the population &apos;s most unhealthy .
that will be , in the next one or two decades , of the national statistics of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me that this topic , or at least should be the most interesting political debate for the <unk> over the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m a <unk> . i &apos;m doing video games .
i &apos;ve been working on for 10 years now . and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality , as it is in <unk> .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of them , to spend more time playing the playing and playing games .
we &apos;re currently spending three billion hours a week with <unk> .
and some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe a little too much time when you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research research on the institute for the future is the opposite of the opposite .
three billion hours per week are not nearly enough to solve the most problems in the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on the planet , we need to increase dramatically .
i calculated that the time for 21 billion hours is time at 21 billion hours .
this seems to be something more important first , so i repeat it to help us do it , if we &apos;re problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to end end of the next decade .
no , i mean it really serious .
why ? this image is quite exactly why i believe games are so essential for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is an tudor portrait of the photographer phil <unk> .
he wanted to capture the emotion of play , so he set up a camera before the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might have some of the nuances of the <unk> in this picture .
you probably see this kind of urgency , a bit of fear , but also a lot of concentration , very deep into solving a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re playing , you can see some of the nuances here , and the mouth are <unk> , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of a so-called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . so , let &apos;s have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that so positive that they didn &apos;t know it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if they reach , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re actually capable of doing something like this . that &apos;s a <unk> victory .
this player is a <unk> victory on a <unk> victory .
and this is what we need to see at millions of faces of <unk> around the world when we take the barriers of the next century , the face of those who are <unk> at the edge of a <unk> <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more likely to see this face in real life when we &apos;re a tough problem .
i call it a &quot; in life i &apos;m bad at life , and it &apos;s actually my face , see ? yeah ? ok .
that &apos;s me , i &apos;m doing this , &quot; i &apos;m bad . &quot;
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. , why we studied in games better than in real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good as we are in play .
and i don &apos;t mean just that much , even though that &apos;s about it .
we &apos;re getting more in <unk> . i mean , i &apos;m good at doing with motivation , to do something more , inspired by collaboration with each other .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i think many of us are moving into our best version , at anytime and immediately , to help solve the problem , as long as necessary , to try to fix it after the <unk> .
and in reality , when we fail to make obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel fatigue . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
we &apos;ve never had these feelings when we play games , they &apos;re just not .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why can &apos;t it be impossible to think , think you could not just achieve anything ?
how can we translate these feelings from playing into reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft that offers the ideal environment to collaborative problem problem .
and i found some things that are <unk> down the epic <unk> in the way .
so first of all , if you go into one of these <unk> , in the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters who are willing to give you a <unk> mission , and that &apos;s right .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level in the game , right ?
so they can do this .
they never get a job they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edges of their capabilities , so they have to be a lot of it , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around and you &apos;re <unk> , and you have to do something important .
and there are plenty of staff .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to finish their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that in real life as simple as being that a <unk> of plastic staff .
also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspirational story , why we are there and what we have to do .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard of &quot; level high , &quot; and &quot; the + 1 power &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in real life .
when i leave this stage , i &apos;m not going to speak : + one , and + 1 crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in the real life of this feedback .
so , the problem of the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so gratifying to stand at any on the edge of a <unk> bed , that we &apos;d rather spend our time in these <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
today , all the world of <unk> have spent together million years of working with the virtual problems of <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound evil .
but to see it in the context of <unk> million years ago , we started to go upright .
so the first <unk> primate .
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend with play , this is just meaning that if you &apos;re in terms of the scale of human development , what &apos;s extraordinary .
but also appropriate , because it turns out , by using this whole time , we &apos;re using the play , actually changing what we &apos;re as humans .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative , highly beings .
that &apos;s the truth . i think it &apos;s the truth .
now , consider this interesting statistic that recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university : the average young man from today in a country with strong <unk> spends 10,000 hours with <unk> labor to the 21 .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
first , for kids in the united states , <unk> hours are the exact <unk> that they spend in school , from the five school to degree degree -- if you never &apos;t .
so here we have a complete <unk> , where young people learn as learn what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book by malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> , &quot; read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of <unk> that if we spend 10,000 hours with the average of a <unk> , we &apos;re going to spend a lot of time in the 21st 12 , we &apos;re going to be at master &apos;s .
we &apos;re going to do so well , whatever , like the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are the players are doing good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we &apos;d never have a human potential before .
so many people have now in the world at least one hour a day with <unk> .
this is our <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good in &quot; something . &quot;
and the next decade we have another billion players , which are extraordinary good in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it , you haven &apos;t heard .
the production systems developed developed , and energy savings , and work on <unk> , instead of the <unk> , so that players all over the world , especially in india , china , brazil can play online .
you expect a extra billion player in the next decade .
and we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is , to do this games to master .
here are the four things i found . first of all , <unk> .
ok , imagine how extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do something right now to master a copy of a , believing that we have a strong hope for success .
player always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to try and , and that &apos;s the same .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters of the heart of social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show that we like people like us , after we &apos;ve played with them , even if they &apos;ve defeated us .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone a game .
we trust that somebody &apos;s time to us that the rules are going to be that we have the same goal and to keep on the <unk> .
so the <unk> enables the growing of bonds , trust and with each other .
as a result of that , we build stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours plays a week , sort of as a <unk> .
the reason is that if we play play , we &apos;re actually happier at working hard as we don &apos;t relax or do nothing .
we know that as human beings work optimal , when we do hard , meaningful work .
and player always are willing to work hard if you get the right job .
and finally , epic significance .
player love to become part of awe of <unk> missions .
here &apos;s a <unk> to put that into the right light , and you all know wikipedia , the largest wiki in the world .
the second mountain of the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other topic in every other item in the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
they are people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is you believe you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is brilliant . he &apos;s looking at why people spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to be <unk> of <unk> in a virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like i -- i develop games ; i &apos;m a little more <unk> .
so he says that makes sense , because players can reach more in <unk> than in real life .
they can engage with social bonds than in real life , they get more feedback and reward in play than they live in the real life .
so he says , it &apos;s completely logical now that players are more time in the virtual world than they are in the real world .
i just just to say that &apos;s logical .
but definitely , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
we need to start transforming the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from a event that <unk> 2,500 years of <unk> .
there &apos;s this ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
so , was <unk> , there was a <unk> .
and these were kind of the first of people developed <unk> .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the formulation of the old greek <unk> , you may know this story . the story of how and why we were invented games .
it &apos;s been <unk> , <unk> , in the kingdom of <unk> , in the kingdom of <unk> , in a famine .
and laennec , there was such a great famine that the king of <unk> decided to come up with a crazy idea .
people suffered . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
so they invented , according to the <unk> , the <unk> and the national strategy . one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much into the <unk> , because games are so fascinating and with us with <unk> , <unk> productivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then , next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> , for 18 years , survived this famine by eating one day and playing next .
so , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we &apos;re playing games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re playing games to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , and in the real life , it &apos;s not satisfying , and we &apos;re going to take ourselves out of play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s exciting .
it was <unk> , after 18 years , not a famine , so the king decided to be a last <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they played a <unk> , and the <unk> were to break into a <unk> adventure .
they went out and they went to search for a new home , and they just just as many people , as they were , and they were looking for food and looking for the rest of a neighborhood where they could thrive .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but what latest <unk> show is that the <unk> that later the roman empire , the same kind of dna as the old <unk> .
so scientists recently thought that <unk> &apos;s insane story is true .
and geologists found evidence of a global economy that could explain almost 20 years , which could explain famine .
so this crazy story could be true .
maybe they actually saved their people through play by having 18 years in games , and then they had these <unk> and then had so much about each other playing with each other , they rescued the entire civilization .
so , we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real time in the world of <unk> . this was 16 years ago .
they were <unk> for 18 years , we &apos;ve been doing warcraft for 16 years .
i say we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of their civilization on search for a new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion <unk> a week .
we should be killing that half of us spend an hour a day playing with play until we solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask you , &quot; how do we solve problems in real world in games ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve done my work in recent years on the institute for the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it <unk> how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
what we want is the future .
we want to think about the best outcome , and then people empower the idea to do this .
we &apos;re facing the epic leaders , and we give people the opportunity to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you just three games that i designed to try to get people out of their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> that you have to get through a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it &apos;s realistic for them and actually live their real life with their own , and they &apos;re actually having their real life , and they &apos;re going to figure out how to do their real life , and they have to figure out how they do their real life , if it &apos;s true , and we ask them to do their real life , and we ask them to hire videos about videos or video or photos .
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 gamers in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied it for the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but when you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure , &quot; you &apos;re going to go , &quot; we &apos;re going to go oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure to be about .
find out how they would survive , most of our players have <unk> in play with the game .
so we &apos;ve been able to do a bigger , bigger target than just <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute for the future .
the point is that the principle of the is that people have only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called the global <unk> <unk> , of course .
so the call of player , we &apos;ve just done a <unk> , we &apos;ve made a <unk> <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> , where there &apos;s the &quot; <unk> . &quot; they have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , and only together , they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just 5 people , we say , everyone is in the mode of state , and it &apos;s our job to make the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players playing the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they google &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game we bring out at the third of march , and it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the the world bank , you get social social <unk> , in 2010 .
we work with universities in the sub-saharan africa , and invite them to learn social judgment .
we have a comic strip that we have &quot; level high , &quot; to <unk> , sustainability , vision and vision .
i &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game with young people , around the world , mostly in <unk> , who benefit from being their own social enterprise to save the world .
i &apos;m going to go to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what , do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope you agree to me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
we have all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to <unk> close social nets , and the desire for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we play playing meaningful games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;ll design these games and play .
when i go back to the next decade , i &apos;m sure that we can create every single future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the <unk> games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what i was a a computer writing a a computer article a few months ago .
i always played my <unk> sports , but i was done with the reflection of text , and i realized that i &apos;ve never been in my life , what the word &quot; disabled &quot; is .
i &apos;ll read you the post .
disabled , <unk> : <unk> , helpless , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and weak .
<unk> : healthy , strong , strong .
i read this list a friend aloud , and i was laughing , it was so ridiculous , but i was just so &quot; singing &quot; and i was just <unk> , and i had to stop reading and <unk> , and then i had to collect myself after this <unk> and <unk> emotional shock .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> , and i just thought the topic has to be pretty old .
but it was actually a copy of the early 1980s when i started with elementary school , and started building my sense of my <unk> <unk> , and forms , also in other children and the rest around me .
and i was not using a <unk> at that time .
if i was that post , i would be born in a world that someone like me would perceive , whose life could be positive , their lives , but now i &apos;m going to be for the opportunities and adventure i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately went to <unk> the <unk> of 2009 , and i expected to find a <unk> contribution here .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , they &apos;re not much better .
and i &apos;m particularly , the last two words , under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; are all very , &quot; very &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we build these values .
our language influenced our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many more societies societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed that the pronunciation of a <unk> has a big force because what you can &apos;t do is <unk> .
so , what do we actually want to do -- a disabled person or a powerful person ?
just to say a people as a child , they could be , and they could get up and get them to their ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open up doors ?
a human being opened open for me was my pediatrician at the <unk> <unk> institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> , and a <unk> , whose name , the name of the name , the most americans couldn &apos;t get out of , so he was always called dr. p. .
and dr. <unk> used to be very colorful , and was just working for kids with just like construction .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- except my <unk> .
i had to practice seemingly infinite practice with these thick , elastic <unk> -- in different colors -- you know , in different colors , and i hated that tape more than anything else , and i hated it . i hated it . i hated it .
and , even , i even as a child with dr. p. and so trying to stop the exercise , <unk> without success .
and one day he was watching me at one of my practice -- these exercise were just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to tear one of those ribbons one day .
and if you do it , i give you a hundred bucks . &quot;
and it was just a simple trick from dr. <unk> , so i do the practice i didn &apos;t want to do , with the prospect that gary <unk> girl was in the second stick , but he actually got me to see my daily life with new eyes , so it became a new and appealing experience .
and i wonder how much his vision of me as a strong and intense young girl shaped my hero , and i could imagine thinking as a of nature from strong , powerful and eternal human .
this is just an example of many , like adults in <unk> , can stimulate the imagination of a child .
but as the already pointed out examples of the <unk> , our language makes us not room to imagine what we would all wish to be able to see it as a powerful person .
our language was <unk> the social change that caused by a technological change in many cases .
and of course , from the medical standpoint , you can say that my legs , the <unk> of <unk> and artificial <unk> for aging , artificial <unk> for the body that are allowing people to do their own , not to speak out the <unk> of social , human beings , to make their own identity , in its own way , and define the <unk> of the <unk> cables that they choose to choose .
so maybe this technological change , the , the , that there &apos;s always a different truth , that every human being can give something very acutely and very powerful , and that human ability to adapt , our biggest plus our biggest .
human ability is adapt -- it &apos;s an interesting story , because people are asking me to tell me how to do with <unk> , and i &apos;m always going to feel very uncomfortable with this phrase , never <unk> , and i always feel very uncomfortable about answering people &apos;s questions , and i think i i understand why .
this sentence from interacting with <unk> lives is that success or happiness depends on being a challenge , not being able to master the challenge , not if my life was so successful , because i could find the possible fall of a life with a prosthetic , or as people are me with my disability .
but the truth is , we &apos;re changing . of course we are , of course , whether it &apos;s physical , emotionally or or either either .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
<unk> are not obstacle that we need to be able to make better clear with our lives .
<unk> are just in our lives .
and i tend to think of <unk> as a shadow .
sometimes i realize it &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s not very disappointed , but he &apos;s always in me .
and i want to argue that no effect of the impact of the people &apos;s impact .
there are <unk> and challenges , and they &apos;re just real real real and each person walks up with it , but the question isn &apos;t whether we get to <unk> or not , but as we can get with it .
so we &apos;re not only responsible for the people who we love to preserve before <unk> , but they &apos;re also ready to get out of it .
and we don &apos;t like our kids if we feel the feeling they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to say two things : one of the medical fact is to be amputated , and to the other social opinion about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability that i had to sit up with is that the world is constantly holding it , it could describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect the people who are on the heart and tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical forecast , or even even organizing a <unk> of life that expects them to pay attention to that we don &apos;t have to make the fact that somebody is actually disabled .
maybe the the concept that we &apos;re looking at is what &apos;s in a broken broken , and how we repair it , for every single disability than the computer .
if we don &apos;t treat a human holistically , and not all of its forces and possibilities and acknowledge , we &apos;re going to be able to bring to the natural battle that you might have to lead to , another disease .
we have a people who for our society to value .
so we have to look at the <unk> and look at all of the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between the perception of our <unk> and our great organizational , a connection .
we should not be <unk> or <unk> at this <unk> times , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , we should be able to go underneath the carpet , but it &apos;s about to find out the <unk> opportunities .
i &apos;m maybe excited about being clear that we don &apos;t have to overcome <unk> , but we &apos;re open to <unk> them to <unk> them at the <unk> , and maybe to use a <unk> and maybe dance with it .
and maybe we can manage to think of as as something natural , <unk> and useful and so we don &apos;t feel like <unk> through their presence anymore .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 . birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin has written about evolution , in my eyes , something very true in the human character .
i would rearrange it this way : not the most of its life , and not the <unk> of its way , but the one who can really adapt to the best .
from conflicts , creativity .
not only darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive and to survive , from the struggle of the human mind is determined to change through conflict .
so again , gradually and adjusting , the great capacity of human beings are .
and maybe we know only what wood we &apos;re <unk> when we &apos;re really <unk> .
perhaps that &apos;s the meaning of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give <unk> a new meaning that goes beyond heavy times .
maybe we can see <unk> as change .
<unk> are for a change that we haven &apos;t yet adapted to .
i think the biggest damage that we have to do is believe that we should be normal .
so , who is normal ?
there is no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical typical , but not the normal , and you would really want to learn these poor , gray person , if it really would have it ?
i think rather than not .
it would be great if we could put this this paradigm of <unk> against another of the capabilities or the strength to even more dangerous , to use , to give us the forces of very many kids , and invite them to engage their very special and valuable skills in society .
what we &apos;ve found is that we have people from the members of our society have a single to be useful and to contribute to a contribution .
there are evidence that the neanderthals have been people and people with severe physical injuries , and that might have happened because the <unk> in the <unk> of these people was valuable for society .
they didn &apos;t look at these people as faceless and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city where i grew up in a <unk> in the red zone , in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there with a <unk> tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i was around , and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you can &apos;t remember me .
when i first saw her , i was bringing her out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , that &apos;s the .
and of course , it &apos;s done click .
this was dr. <unk> , a man who i knew from my mother &apos;s stories about this day , of course , because i was , of course , two weeks to late .
the doctor &apos;s doctor &apos;s physician was in vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , not at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet had been after you , and i just had a few toes on this one and and i had a <unk> on the other foot , and he was the <unk> , the <unk> had to be the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never be as <unk> as other children or that you could never have a independent life , and since then they just have me lying . &quot;
what i found was really extraordinary was that he had collected my whole childhood , whether i won won in a <unk> in the second grade , whether i had won my scholarship or a <unk> , i had failed my scholarship or a <unk> , and he used these clips to teach his students , <unk> from the medical school school and the chief medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> , the x factor , the potential of the human being .
you can &apos;t just emphasize how crucial this factor is for the quality of a human being .
and dr. <unk> said on , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that children , if you &apos;re not told anything else , and even if you get a little bit of support , you get kids out of your , you can get a lot of time . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone would deal with it , are two different things .
and even i changed my thinking over time , if you asked me about 15 years old , if i had my <unk> out of flesh and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have <unk> .
i was just trying to do normal .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure .
and that &apos;s what happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not even despite these experiences .
and maybe this change could happen because i &apos;ve been meeting so many people who have opened doors , rather than people who are me or me to do a imagination .
you see , it really needs a person who shows them how to fix their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate its own , , the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do that , and for someone in a critical moment , a door is open to a door , then they &apos;re a very good teacher for those people .
they &apos;re bringing them doors to open up doors .
the real meaning of the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means something that is in one is the potential .
so , what is we want to do ?
in the 1960s , in the u.k. , the u.k. was done , they were <unk> in <unk> .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , call that &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the students are broken down for notes .
and the a student is going to be harder , get the better teachers so on .
they &apos;ve done a <unk> student students with a &quot; good &quot; grade &quot; very well , and they were told they were very smart , and after those three months , they really wrote <unk> .
and of course , it breaks down to the heart that vice versa was told , they &apos;re just enough .
and then , after the three months , it was .
but only those who were still in school -- except from the students who had dropped the school .
and the key thing that this study was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that the <unk> , and that the students with the grade , they have taught them , and they &apos;ve taught them something about them and they treated them .
the only real disability is a <unk> mind a mind that has broken broken , has no hope , he finds no more faith in him , doesn &apos;t feed him our natural , most <unk> and our innate capacity of imagination .
but if we can do it , to support the human spirit , hope to keep ourselves and other people around find beautiful , curious and confident , then we &apos;re really to our forces .
if a mind is about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new organizational .
i want to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet named <unk> , and my friend jacques <unk> , and the friend of &quot; the god , &quot; god , who knows only four words . &quot; the god who knows only four words , and the god , who knows only four words and he god , he &apos;s saying , come , come , dance with me . &quot;
come , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
suppose i said that through few changes of your genes , a better memory could have -- more more and more quickly .
or want to be more powerful , stronger , more powerful .
would you like to become more and more confident ?
how about good health longer to live ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who are always more creativity .
which one would you most like ?
which one would you like to have if you could have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
check your hands . let me see .
a few . probably , probably , as many people are there .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose for a good mind ?
some more .
so about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to do this as a doctor .
if you could have one of those , it would be a whole different world .
is this all fantasy ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been a <unk> topic here on ted ted conference , but today i want to tell you about the idea of a doctor &apos;s mind .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , wrote a essay called &quot; nothing in biology , no sense of sense but in the <unk> of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who accept not sufficient to biological evolution , it would be a very good time to get rid of your own , and i &apos;ll give you permission -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn <unk> &apos; book , which is about wrong , because nothing else is going to make any sense of it .
but if you accept biological evolution , what is it that it &apos;s just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for others or or is it us ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this picture , i put a bush as a center of the <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the margins of life , all the <unk> <unk> on the tops of these branches have success in evolutionary achievement , they survive ; they survive ; it has its environment and its strength .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , is of course , what we most interested in .
we &apos;re sharing from a common ancestor of modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe 20 or 25 different shades of hominids .
some people came and went .
we &apos;ve been here about <unk> years .
it seems like we &apos;re right close from the other parts of life , but actually the most part , the basic principles are the same as the same .
do you realize that we can pull from this and and the the of a shared bacteria , can produce the protein of the human genome that &apos;s used to treat the ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s the equivalent of what &apos;s coming from the pancreas .
and when we &apos;re talking about bacteria , you realize that each of us in our gut leads more bacteria than it leads to cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times a lot .
i mean , think if antonio damasio asks for her <unk> , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s wet , it &apos;s very sweet .
and you will all of nutrients that you could just want without giving effort to do .
it &apos;s a really easier way for bacteria , with a <unk> of <unk> , forced forced to the end .
but , you know , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they &apos;re important to their lives .
they help in the digestion of the <unk> nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will be in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> balance in a species ?
or are we going to be something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s step back to the big bang over 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , and a half billion years ago -- the first <unk> organisms , perhaps three to four billion years ago -- the first <unk> organisms , maybe as much as a 800 or a billion years -- and then the human species , which is actually shaping the last year .
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is just short to pay ; the animal animal , like a single <unk> , and the human life , a little <unk> .
that &apos;s us .
and this represents the <unk> of these speech , so i hope , what i &apos;ve enjoyed you .
now , when i was a college student in college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i was , something very basic : most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , every cell , and all the genetic information of the cell will continue to be in both hemispheres .
but at the time , when <unk> organisms came out , they began to change .
sexual reproduction is in the picture .
and very important : the introduction of sexual reproduction that the genome is going to be <unk> the rest of the body .
in fact , in fact , the <unk> of death of death in evolution is going to occur in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now i must say , if i was a college writer , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex , death -- it seemed pretty reasonable to sex -- it seemed like a <unk> , but every year , it has come to my other .
i &apos;ve come to understand the emotions of george burns , who in las vegas in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
before him , a beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization of being a doctor that i was a goal of the goal of evolution -- not necessarily understood , except for the purpose of evolution , just different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to reconnect health of a disease .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the generation of the genome to the next generation , customization and survival generation .
from a evolutionary standpoint , they &apos;re and i &apos;ve been developing rockets to make the genetic <unk> into the next stage of the orbit to then fall into the sea .
i think we would all get the mood that the food that would have to expression , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to be <unk> through my work .
i want to reach it by not going to die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to be the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t inevitably inevitably the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution is the creatures that are best to adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
the the bottom of the ocean are bacteria that are <unk> , and so the the steam , the steam , if fish were there , it would have a vacuum of fish fish , yet they have made a <unk> environment to do it .
so , what that means is that if we look at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the place in evolution , and particularly we &apos;re going to go into the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a number of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move .
we have reached a kind of balance .
and the reason for that would be that we had been able to get a lot of genes that were otherwise <unk> , and have been <unk> out of the population .
and secondly , as a species , we have so much that we &apos;ve made this environment that we &apos;ve done it , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we wander and we wander and so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for evolution to be <unk> .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of traditional species , of course , imposed by the forces of nature .
and the argument , here , is that the wheels of evolution are slowly drifting away , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far as isolation , when we colonize a species distant planet , it will be remote and the changes of the environment that evolution might produce in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a <unk> , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that &apos;s not just natural , but led , and decided to be the <unk> of ourselves as a <unk> of the decisions we do .
so how did this happen ?
how could it be that we do this ?
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people today make decisions about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
so think if it could be the gender of your child , but also to the body genetic adaptations that would cure and prevent disease .
what if they could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or eliminate the reduce of risk or stroke ?
would you not want to make these changes in their genes ?
when we zoom in , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
the next year , when it was finished , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can take a sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome to a $ 20,000 <unk> and in the room of about a week .
it won &apos;t take long long time to get reality that it will be 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly accessible to everyone .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering was the <unk> prize for francis arnold and <unk> <unk> , two scientists who developed the natural process of inventing to encourage the process faster and to work faster and to <unk> protein in a more threatening -- which <unk> arnold evolution .
a few years ago , the <unk> <unk> <unk> awarded awarded his research to his research , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , and through manipulation of only four genes , the cell , to turn them to a <unk> stem cells -- a cell potentially potentially potentially able to be able to be in your body .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that makes the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that not only protect themselves , but also to the immunity to other viruses .
whether it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with influenza that has been grown up in the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine something good from tobacco ?
this is all reality , and in the future , it &apos;s going to be much more possible .
so , imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or the <unk> , to give your children a better chance of living life -- eliminating the diabetes , eliminating the risk of preventing cancer from cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want healthier kids ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science that can allow the change to prevent disease , also to allow us to adopt <unk> , <unk> , the better memory .
why don &apos;t the <unk> of a ken <unk> <unk> , especially if you can extend it with the next generation of <unk> ?
why not have the fast <unk> that they can allow them to run faster and longer ?
why no longer life ?
they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re on a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we will be transformed by <unk> evolution to the <unk> .
we &apos;re going to have a process that could actually requires 100,000 years , and we can compress it for a thousand years -- and maybe even for the next 100 years .
these are decisions with their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to be .
are we using these decisions to form a society that is better more successful than the more successful one ?
or are we going to selectively choose a different attributes that we want for some of us to do , not for others ?
will we have a society of molding and <unk> , or more robust and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to be faced with .
and the deepest deepest of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom of the wisdom that we need to make these decisions ?
in good good as in evil , and early than you might think that these decisions are going to be us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine now , a portable robot that gives you exquisite skills , or another , the <unk> help to stand up and go .
we at berkeley <unk> , we call these robots .
they &apos;re not different than something that they &apos;re going to do in the morning and give them extra strength and that will increase their speed , and they will help them maintain their balance for example .
this is indeed the true <unk> of human and machine .
but not only that -- and it &apos;s connecting them with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldiers who are wearing about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the request that they should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of it -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought that we would embrace this challenge and create a <unk> that would help deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to <unk> -- or the human universal <unk> .
soldier : i can wear 200 pounds of <unk> terrain , many hours long .
his flexible design allows you to fall deep , to crawl and to highly <unk> movements .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and then i will convert my strength and stamina .
we &apos;re at the same time to introduce our <unk> of this device , this new <unk> of life in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s look at our view of the wheelchair , something i &apos;m passionate about .
there are 68 million people sitting in the wheelchair in the wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that is indeed a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord , who in the height of their life -- baby , <unk> , <unk> -- the fate of the , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the population population , whose number multiplied .
and so the only option -- when it comes to a <unk> , or by other complications -- is wheelchair .
and so , it &apos;s been , by the way , for 500 years , since his , i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a whole new chapter in the area of mobility .
now let me introduce you to <unk> that by amanda <unk> , who was a <unk> <unk> , who had a <unk> result , that it didn &apos;t run for the age of 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda is our <unk> .
it has sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals on our <unk> , which is attached to its back here .
here &apos;s also <unk> , the <unk> is on their hips , as well as their <unk> that they move forward in this very <unk> and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> while a <unk> <unk> me .
i lost every feeling of every second , every feeling and every movement below my <unk> .
not long after that , a doctor step into my <unk> and he said , &quot; amanda , you can never go back . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel every <unk> hope of my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have been to me since then learning to go skiing , to climb , to drive the hands of the wheel .
but nothing was invented me to go back to me until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and discuss them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change life , not just for the soldiers , or for amanda , or for amanda here and all wheelchair , but for everyone .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m a ceo of a non-profit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t <unk> poverty , i &apos;m <unk> as a <unk> of a volunteer volunteer in a volunteer .
well , in our city , in the volunteers , a <unk> <unk> , you have to be pretty early on the <unk> to be able to <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer at the <unk> , so i had quite good chance to be able to do it .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the <unk> <unk> and find out what our jobs would be .
when i found the <unk> , he had just been in a very serious conversation with the <unk> , certainly one of the worst days of their life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was standing in the <unk> and her <unk> under a screen in the <unk> rain , while her house was in fire .
the other volunteer who was just in front of me -- call him <unk> <unk> -- graduated the <unk> first , asked asked to go into the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was <unk> envy .
there was some lawyer or a <unk> , who now for the rest of his life , could tell people that he went to a living house to save an living living , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next one .
the <unk> <unk> me .
he said , &quot; come , you need to go into the house .
you have to go up , you have to go over the fire , and you have to get this woman a couple shoes . &quot;
i swear .
now , not exactly what i hoped i had , but i went -- the <unk> , the hallway , to the real &quot; <unk> &quot; by the <unk> that were pretty pretty finished to get into the bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was my prey back down , where i was at the front door at my <unk> and the beloved dog .
we put our treasures out to the <unk> , where , not surprisingly , his own more attention than mine .
and a few weeks later , the <unk> had a letter of the <unk> , where they were <unk> for the brave use of saving their house .
one of the things that was fundamental is that somebody even had a pair of shoes .
and in my career with robin hood and in my <unk> as a volunteer , i &apos;m witness about generosity and kindness in the big scale , but i also see the altruism and the <unk> of individual .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at this room and see people who have either been achieved a success success or have a <unk> on their way , i want to offer memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in one other &apos;s life until you have your first million .
if you have something , you give it right now .
use it in a <unk> , , put a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us a chance to save the human &apos;s lives , but every day offers the opportunity to change one .
so they go ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of human rights .
a place where women lead the <unk> , sex , and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , your balance .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the jungle of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees , our nearest living relative .
that means we have a common ancestor , a evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
as the chimpanzees from large , violent <unk> fellows , the <unk> of <unk> female female will run female female female female female female female .
they really came up with this because that &apos;s led to a very <unk> society , which is not seen seen by lethal violence in the lethal majority .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known to the primates .
they &apos;re in the depths of the <unk> , and they &apos;re difficult to get the observation .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness -- the scene of a violent debate that has been <unk> for decades and almost as many lives as the world i.
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction are the survival of the bonobos .
<unk> and the decline of the <unk> lead to that you could &apos;t even fill a stadium with the <unk> bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laughing the trees .
who are these relatives ?
we know it as &quot; love instead war , &quot; because they have <unk> , even sex sex , with partners partners , and rules , and rules , and social networking .
now i &apos;m not saying that this would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because the bonobos are made out of more than the <unk> .
bonobos -- like humans -- love to play for their lives .
play is not just <unk> .
for us , and it &apos;s fundamental to the attachment between relationships and the care of tolerance .
and we &apos;re learning trust and the rules of the game .
play is increasing creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interaction , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connection .
and if you watch bonobos at the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human beings , dance dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> that we &apos;re <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique shots straight from the wild .
first a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we see a young female and male in a <unk> .
look at what it does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of the evolutionary origin , &quot; she &apos;s going to put it in the eggs . &quot;
i think it &apos;s more like me , it &apos;s not true .
yeah .
so , <unk> are common , both in bonobos and people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the <unk> that you bring new elements into play -- like the testes -- and also , the game is both and more -- while it makes a lot of fun .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take a lot of shapes , some of which some of you might be quiet , curious , curious -- maybe to discover the wonder again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she &apos;s playing with with water .
i think just like you are playing alone , and we &apos;re <unk> boundaries of our inner and the <unk> worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore and interact , and the unexpected <unk> that we form are the real <unk> of creativity .
this is just a little <unk> on the insights that bonobos have us in our past and the present .
but they also also a secret for our future , a future where we have to adapt to growing challenges , through greater creativity and <unk> cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
we have to adapt to a hyper-connected world , we need to play .
but will we make the best out of our <unk> ?
now , game is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobo bonobos and people , life is not made out of teeth and claws alone .
if it hardly seems to be , game might seem to be at the end .
and therefore , my <unk> , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution and play together , while we &apos;re extending the <unk> and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs of , in the middle of 1979 , at the same moment , every single moment , every <unk> baby -- okay .
so two pairs , every <unk> a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time using the <unk> , because if you &apos;re constantly imagining the time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
think of that for a second .
and in this scenario , imagine that the sperm is carrying a y <unk> that represents the x chromosome of the <unk> .
and in the other case , the sperm is wearing a x chromosome that meets the x chromosome of the <unk> .
they &apos;re both <unk> , both fire .
we &apos;ll come back to these guys later .
most of my people , i have two symbols on the .
under a hat , i &apos;m involved in the history of anatomy .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy -- that &apos;s human body , animal bodies -- like they were <unk> with <unk> , with <unk> ; as they thought about bodies .
the other hat i carried in my work is the prime man , as a <unk> -- or , as i say sometimes , as a controversial lawyer -- from people who are doctors from doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have <unk> , who have social norms .
so for example , i worked with people who are identical twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were smaller than common .
and i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people , who are the gender , so people who have not the average male or female <unk> .
and as general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you some examples of the types of <unk> that are not <unk> to the male or female standard .
in one case , you might have someone with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the y <unk> , the <unk> that we all have at stage stage , too testes .
and that &apos;s why the testes are <unk> at the stage stage .
but because this individual is lack of the receptors to detect the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
and that &apos;s called <unk> .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to that .
as a result , the body develops more the size of the typical female .
when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it takes takes time until it gets puberty and growing their breasts , and they &apos;re developing , but not getting their period , until somebody comes to that is something different .
and they do a couple of tests and they find that instead of <unk> and <unk> , they actually <unk> up and they have a y chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you might think that person actually actually male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something that &apos;s called <unk> .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the <unk> are made <unk> , which is the <unk> hormones .
most of the women , like me -- i believe i typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual math , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like i actually talk about <unk> .
we produce <unk> and we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
the consequence is that someone like me actually actually had a brain that was more <unk> than a woman who was born with testicles , and having a <unk> .
so , sex is really complicated ; <unk> are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some ways , can be spread over the whole range .
another example , a couple of years ago , i received the call of a 19 man man who was young , when young , he had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as man , and he just figured out he had a <unk> and a uterus .
he had a extreme form of an innate <unk> .
he &apos;s got <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , his <unk> were so highly active that they basically created a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> male was being owned , his brain was exposed to the most unhealthy male of the <unk> .
and when he was born , he saw like a boy -- no one was going to do something .
and only when he was 19 , he got enough medical problems , actually because he was inside that the doctors found that he was in the inner .
okay , just a quick example of a <unk> of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , something called the <unk> , is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so , in many different varieties of people , you can .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- be it <unk> or <unk> twins , if it &apos;s <unk> -- of surgeons often often to the norm is not because this is be the physical health of the benefit .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why often of you are often made different kinds of surgical interventions is because they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that a particular anatomical index is related to a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is to have a female identity , to be a black person , to be a black person , to have an african anatomy in terms of its own story .
so we have this awful <unk> idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body that &apos;s actually something very different for us , it &apos;s confused us to this <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about <unk> .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is , when kids are born , who are two people in a body .
where i &apos;ve experienced most of the excitement , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last year , whose gender was asked in berlin .
and many journalists call me the question of , &quot; what test will you do , which will tell us whether or is <unk> <unk> female female female female female ? &quot;
and i had to explain that journalists that this test is not .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not <unk> between male and female , or male and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> ; <unk> are us , that are this line , of course , that &apos;s the line .
so we have a situation like this , the further our science inevitably , we have to be so <unk> to the those categories that we &apos;ve made for robust anatomical categories , which are very simple <unk> to create permanent <unk> , much more powerful than we &apos;ve imagined .
and it &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also in race to what it &apos;s much more complicated than our <unk> has approved .
we &apos;re in our essays , we get into all kinds of <unk> spaces .
we &apos;re talking about the fact that at least 95 percent of our dna have in common with chimpanzees .
what should we do with the fact that we only vary from a few of ?
while we continue to continue our science , we get increasingly into a zone of the field of where we have to acknowledge that the <unk> categories we &apos;ve probably had too simple .
we see this in all sorts of different parts of the human life .
one of the areas that we see in the <unk> , in our culture , in the united states , are the fighting of the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard talks about what point of the body is going to be human , so that it &apos;s a different right than the fetal life .
we have very difficult to do this today -- perhaps not as public as in medicine -- about the question of when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never really hard to fight the question when someone was dead .
they have kept a a feather under the nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t buried it yet .
if you didn &apos;t move , you &apos;d buried it .
but today we are in a situation where we &apos;re going to take people people antiretroviral organs and want to put them to people .
and as a result , we set up with the really hard question , when someone is dead , and that &apos;s going to bring us into a really difficult place where we don &apos;t have as simple categories .
now , you assume that the <unk> of categories of someone like me would really make me happy .
i &apos;m political , i &apos;m <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to understand that these categories are really more insecure than we thought , is what &apos;s going on .
and it makes me feel like about the democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i have to first get a chance to get me to be a big fan of founding .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i think they &apos;re so much and strong , and so radical , in which they did , i was looking at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that absolutely to forget .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s been done with the <unk> .
the founding fathers were the of my view of the original activists , which is why .
what she was a <unk> concept , and she was using it by another that was radically and beautiful , and for years of being <unk> .
as you all remember , our founding was driving the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy was on a very curious concept of anatomy .
the <unk> of the old world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of the <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power , they should have political power because of the <unk> <unk> of the grandfather to the son , the son , and so on .
the founding <unk> of this idea and it replaced it through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all humans were created .
they were playing the field of field , and they decided that <unk> that are common , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they did this part because they were part of a <unk> system , two things together together .
democracy grew , but at the same time , science was also growing .
if you look at the history of the founding fathers , it &apos;s clear that many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a geopolitical world .
they went away from explanations , and they were <unk> things like an supernatural concept of power , where the transmission on a very <unk> concept of <unk> .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and for example , if you look at the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they had a concept that was <unk> common .
and so they have prepared the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it that way , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after that years ?
for example , women used the <unk> , the concept of the social , which says that anatomical activity is more important than anatomical difference , and said , &quot; we have a uterus and <unk> , &quot; we &apos;re not the <unk> , the right to have the right to own , the right to own , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women <unk> that successful .
so next , the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s about it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> rows of the <unk> who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people have different skin color , which are <unk> to anatomical similarities , again , <unk> , successful .
we see the same thing with the <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , as we can start to look at all the similarities , we have to start asking the question why we sustain certain <unk> .
now , in mind , i &apos;d like to maintain certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i want to say , for example , a fish not the same rights as a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should have the right to give their informed to sex or to marry .
so there are some anatomic <unk> who make sense for me , and that i think should keep on .
but the challenge is to try and figure out what it is and why we keep it , and why they &apos;re meaningful .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been <unk> at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both of the middle 1979 , <unk> the same day .
let &apos;s imagine one of you , maria , three months of <unk> , was born at june 1 , 1980 .
so , , the other hand , the the other hand , is born to the <unk> , so he &apos;s born at march of 1980 .
just because of the fact maria was born three months of <unk> , they would take all kinds of <unk> in the -- the right <unk> sex -- the right to choose the right to choose the right .
so , a &apos;s needs to be on all this , not because he &apos;s got a different biological age , just because of the <unk> of his birth .
we &apos;re still finding other <unk> of what their rights are .
because you &apos;re that he &apos;s male -- although i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s who &apos;s male -- because you think he &apos;s male , so it can now get away , what does &apos;t have to worry about .
and maria , no in all states can &apos;t perceive the same thing that the doctor &apos;s in all states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
a can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman today in a few states .
so we have these <unk> categories that are problematic and wrong in many ways .
and for me , the question is : what will we do , because our science is the advances in anatomy that we have to reach a point where we have to admit that a democracy that &apos;s based on anatomy , could be <unk> ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time it feels like the science is going to be .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture will take a kind of pragmatic posture , &quot; well , we need to move somewhere , so we pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught up in a very strange position .
so for instance , texas texas , texas decided that you &apos;re not having a man to marry , you &apos;re not a y chromosome , and marry a woman , you &apos;ve got a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested to their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i told you about the <unk> .
if we look at one founding of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he gives us in his &quot; i have a dream , &quot; a kind of solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t judge people to &quot; skin color , but after the property of their character , &quot; judge , and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , it sounds like a good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you hire people to their 401 ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute rights in people such because i have to admit that i know a series of golden <unk> that probably more likely to deserve than some people i know .
i want to suggest that i probably know some bright <unk> , the <unk> , are <unk> , more intelligent and more mature decisions to meet sexual relationships than some of the most iconic things i know .
so , how are we going to address the nature &apos;s properties ?
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
and part of me was wondering , what if the content of a personality would be something that would be <unk> in the future -- could we be made by the ?
do we really want to go this way ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is in action to worry about questions of democracy .
in our endeavor for democracy , we have done our thing right , and i think we &apos;d do our thing in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation in iran , for example , where a man who &apos;s attracted sexually to other men , is punished by death unless he is ready to watch a <unk> , which case he can stay alive .
now , states of these things don &apos;t exist with us .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i spoke to a few years ago , who had a few <unk> twins , to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was rubbing him , and he asked him why he did these surgeries -- it was highly <unk> surgeries -- his response to that in his country , these children would be treated very badly , and so he had to do it .
i told him , &quot; now , have you <unk> political asylum instead of <unk> to the surgery ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones they are , without they &apos;re changing the state of the state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
all right , just to finish , i want to notice that i talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibility of what democracy might look like if we had a more involved in the mothers .
and i want to say something about this , a feminist , is a radical thing , and i think that there might be different kinds of insights that are <unk> by various kinds of anatomy , <unk> when people apply a <unk> .
i &apos;ve been interested in years because i was interested in <unk> , i also interested in research in the domain of research .
and one of the things i really thought about is the difference between men and women in ways they think and operate in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , in average , not every , but in average -- are more complex social relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable to people to give a lot of attention .
and so that &apos;s why we think about this , an interesting situation .
years ago , when i was a graduate student , one of my favorite students who i was my interest in feminism -- i was a feminist , so i was doing it -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s the feminism female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about the stereotypes about gender , so that &apos;s what feminism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought there might be something more unacceptable at feminism .
this is to say there might be something , the average , which female brains of male control differ from what makes us tick for social relationships , and <unk> for the <unk> for the <unk> .
so where the fathers were really <unk> , finding how individuals could be protected before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers into this concept , we more a concept of <unk> , not just as you can , but as we can make care of each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go to the future when we think democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual bodies think of what identity is in and more about relationships .
so that , as we as people try to make a connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got in it , i &apos;m going to do a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love to find a different kind of <unk> , <unk> outfit , and also photograph and to convey and also recently .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my <unk> from second hand to <unk> and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> on the environment and also my purse .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually serve a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s going to buy my own personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to have my size ?
am i like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all answers are yes , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;ve been doing for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does someone do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven few of the patients , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for exactly one week are all i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i i did have a bet that i would carry anything i might wear , if i came to palm springs .
and since you &apos;ve heard of me as the woman who &apos;s here at ted in her underwear -- that means i found some things .
and i want to show you my favorite of my birthday for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i &apos;m doing that , i &apos;m going to leave you with some of the lessons that i believe believe whether or not you learned from these <unk> , not to carry anything new .
let &apos;s start sunday .
i call that the <unk> tigers .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost be great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole kind of outfit , including the jacket , was 55 55 , and it was the most expensive piece i carried in this week .
monday : color is a little bit powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you put other happy people .
tuesday : adapting is totally <unk> .
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to be myself and adapt to the same time .
be just who you are .
if you surround yourself with the right people , you &apos;re not only going to understand it , you &apos;ll also appreciate it .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , i look like i &apos;m playing &apos; playing &apos; games or that i remember her peers .
and i &apos;d like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : self-confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking good , it &apos;s pretty safe .
and if you think you &apos;re not look good in something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i got 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
if you believe you &apos;re inside and you &apos;re a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing that you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to <unk> anything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> , sound at all .
and finally , saturday : a , unique unique , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world about one of you without having to say a word .
i was always more repeatedly , and over that week , when people were getting people to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i will give it all back again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn for this week is that it &apos;s okay to let it go .
i don &apos;t have to emotionally <unk> these things , because the same time the corner is going to be a crazy crazy , <unk> , <unk> outfit that only waiting for me when i love a little bit in the heart and looking for it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody together .
i have something i want to show you .
think of this as a hunting , flying a flying <unk> .
this is what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m an italian , and every boy in italy grows up with this picture in his room , but the reason i show you this is something that &apos;s really interesting in the last decade in the last decade .
so , a time ago , if they wanted a piece of race , they would take their budget and give their money to a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver was good enough , it won the race .
now today , you need , if you want to win a race , actually like this one -- something that &apos;s going to be taken in real time , some thousand sensors , the information to the car , and then processing it and then processing them and use those to send this car back to send things back and make things happen in real time .
this would be you , in <unk> , a <unk> .
and basically it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made from two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is the <unk> start in our lives .
our cities have been , in the last couple of years , with networks and electronics .
they become the computer in the free .
and as a computer in the free , start reacting to some other way , you will see and driven .
when we &apos;re cutting cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the paycheck -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with cities , it &apos;s a big deal .
beyond the cities , all of this perceive and driving into objects of everyday life .
this is from a exhibition that &apos;s paola antonelli for moma later , in the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
now , all of our objects , our environment , start to speak back to us .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like every atom out there is going to be both , a sensor and a <unk> .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have out of our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , he says he took his hammer and he threw him on moses -- actually you can still see a little spot <unk> -- and said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
well , today , our environment is starting to respond to the first time .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and embrace it .
let &apos;s start with the .
now the first project i want to imagine is actually one of the first of our lab .
it was in italy a half years ago .
and what we did was actually use a new kind of network that was used around the world -- this is a <unk> -- and <unk> and <unk> information from this network that are being collected by the operators to understand how the city works .
summer was a happier summer -- 2006 .
it was the <unk> of the cheerleaders .
some of you will remember it was a italy in the france , and then at the end of the , the <unk> .
and no , italy , in the end , it won .
now , what happened to this day , just when the activity that happens in the network .
here &apos;s the city .
you see the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
the morning , before the game .
you see the top up .
early afternoon , people here and there , who are calling and moving around .
the game starts -- silence .
france is a gateway . italy makes a gate .
<unk> , people make a short call , go on toilet .
second <unk> . end of normal .
first <unk> , second one .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
well , in that night , everyone went to celebrate the center .
they saw the big <unk> .
the next day , all of the went in the center to meet the <unk> and the prime minister at the same time .
and then they all went down .
you see the picture of space <unk> <unk> , where , since the <unk> time , people go to celebrate people -- to have a big party , and they see the most <unk> at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
another quick example of that , for example , is not about people , but it &apos;s about things we use .
well , now we know all our things about where our things are .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that a mac computer made out of .
but we know just know little about where things go .
so we actually designed some small marker in this project to track the trash while he goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers who were helped us to spend a little more than a year ago , seattle , to spend a lot of things that they could see -- different kinds of things you can see -- things you would take .
then we have the little chips , the little brands , put it on the trash and and we started tracking it .
here &apos;s the results we &apos;ve just got .
from seattle ...
after a week .
and we realized that there is a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data wasn &apos;t available before .
but that &apos;s what happens to a lot of <unk> and complicated things .
but the other thing is , we think that if we see every day , the cup of the cup that we throw away , not just disappears , it &apos;s still on the planet .
and the plastic bottle we still throw away every day .
and if we were to show people , we can move behavior behavior behavior .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could be you a lot more about the and the many other things that you can do with , but i want to talk to the second part of the story that we discussed in the beginning , and that &apos;s the <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did in <unk> , spain a few years ago .
it started with a question of <unk> that came to us and said that spain and <unk> have a beautiful tradition to use water to public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could technology combine technology technology technology ?
and one of the ideas that was at mit with a <unk> was , they imagine these tubes , and valves , valves , valves that open and close .
they cause something like a <unk> with water water .
if these <unk> shelves , you can write on it , you can ads , images , text .
and you can zoom in , and it &apos;s opening up to <unk> them , as you can see on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of <unk> .
it really enjoyed him .
and we got the mission to design a building in the expo of the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building consisted of water .
there are no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open and let it in .
the roof was also covered with water too .
and if it &apos;s windy , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can actually leave the roof down .
or you could finish the building and the architecture , like in this case , you know , this day , when you go the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t crash the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost disappearing .
so here you see the building works .
you see the person wondering what &apos;s going on inside .
and here you see me when i tried to test the sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
well , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors were working .
but actually , it was a even bigger fun in that night .
all the kids from <unk> came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open to be able to make them , but a building that still breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump off without wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , designers , we think about how people use things that use things that use .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are being used and interact with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the projections on it .
and this is what we got to think about this this project project that i &apos;m going to show you .
imagine that <unk> could really start flying .
imagine if you could have little helicopter flying through the air , and each of you with a little <unk> with light light -- almost like a cloud can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter that you saw earlier that moves with others , completely <unk> .
you can have this cloud .
you can have some kind of <unk> screen or display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or irregular , in three dimensions , where what changes , the light is not the position of the <unk> .
they can play with different ways .
imagine the screen could just appear in different <unk> or sizes , different different parts of the screen .
but then it could be a 3d cloud of <unk> that you can get to and through you you move through , and you can look at the eyes that you can look at from many , many directions .
here you see a real <unk> , the <unk> , to form a <unk> v .
if you turn the light , it looks like this . so as we saw before .
imagine that every single one of people is being controlled .
it could have a single <unk> of a impulse that from people , from the movements of people or something .
i want to show you something here first .
we worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in new york and the <unk> -- we &apos;ve taken his movements in 3d to use it as a benchmark for the <unk> .
this is <unk> dancing dance .
on the left-hand side , you see the <unk> , the various <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> .
so they can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once we all have <unk> , they can play with it , and with color , gravity and <unk> play .
we want to use that as a possible impulse for the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we work on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
so the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re looking at people with people in order to change the environment -- almost like we call the <unk> , how to move a <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that everybody can give a small donation for a <unk> .
i think the remarkable thing that the last few years , the last decades , is that we are moved from a physical to a digital world .
that &apos;s all digitized , knowledge , and it &apos;s accessible through the internet .
today , we can take the first time -- and the campaign obama showed this -- can we from the digital world , from the digital forces of the world &apos;s forces .
this can be in our case that we &apos;re using it to design and create a symbol .
that means something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , to give us the challenges challenges -- think about the climate change , or co2 emissions -- how can we transition from the digital world to physical .
so the idea is that we actually actually people with people in the world where they &apos;re doing things together , they do things together .
the cloud is again a cloud of <unk> , in the same way a cloud cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , and our cloud is a cloud of <unk> .
it &apos;s a physical shape in london , but covered with <unk> .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at them from the bottom , share the most important moments of <unk> 2012 and more and more and more , and as a kind of connection to the community .
so both of the things in the sky and something at the top of the sky , and you can go to the top of the city of new york .
you can go in .
and a kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everyone who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , the context is very important .
my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people are not separate from nature , and that it &apos;s all connected to each other .
the first time i was in antarctica , almost 10 years ago , i saw my first <unk> .
i &apos;m inspired awe .
my heart sped , i was a <unk> , trying to figure out what was going on .
the <unk> around me was almost 60 meters from the water , and i only wonder that this was a snowflake on another snowflake , year after year .
and it &apos;s born as a <unk> of a <unk> or by drawing out of <unk> .
every iceberg has its own personality .
they &apos;re interacting with their environment and their experiences .
some people are <unk> up and forwards to the bitter end , while others don &apos;t recognize it and they &apos;re in a <unk> of uninterrupted passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think you &apos;re slightly isolated , separate and alone , as much as we often see us .
but the truth is far away from that .
as a iceberg iceberg , i <unk> his spherical atmosphere .
and the iceberg is choking , it &apos;s <unk> drinking water , which is a lot of life forms .
i go to my footage of these times as if i would make portraits of my ancestors in the mind that they exist in these individual moments of that way , never exist again .
it &apos;s not death when you melt ; it &apos;s not a end , it &apos;s a <unk> of your <unk> along the cycle of life cycle .
part of the ice in the streams of the ice that i &apos;m sending is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last images i &apos;d like to show you , show a chunk that i &apos;ve in in greenland in greenland .
very rare , you actually have a <unk> iceberg .
so here &apos;s what you see .
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please , look at the shape of the iceberg , and where it is at the <unk> .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
it &apos;s about 120 feet of water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like , you see the iceberg of your personality .
thank you .
my life is really blessed by work in some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , this guy was about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading commanders in the 1980s .
then one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i was facing him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so i &apos;ve been doing a complex part of what we &apos;re admire and look at in the art world .
so we decided , tony -- <unk> -- and to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what do you do to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
and i just want to go back to him and i said , &quot; wait a minute , i &apos;m not -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all the paralyzed people communicate with these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , no , only if you heard about higher <unk> and you &apos;ve got a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
ordinary people are not available to the equipment . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how do you know about this ? &quot;
anybody seen the film &apos; film and <unk> ?
so they communicate -- this is how their fingers walk along .
i said , &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need , just a check and instead instead i hired a check that i didn &apos;t have the smallest idea of how i was supposed to be .
i remember , in place , and to his brother and his father -- well , my proposition is , &quot; well , my proposal is , tony , will be able to get a device , and we &apos;ll find a way to get his art back again .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who carries all this , it cannot communicate . &quot;
so i spoke a conference for a few months later at a conference .
i met these people from <unk> , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on every surface , then draw with a <unk> on that , which is just the negative surface .
so they &apos;re moving around and making them <unk> like this .
they say that all things that are displayed up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the layers , and then the <unk> come , and then the <unk> , and finally , people are actually doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentation .
so i went home and ate with my wife , and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , we should find a way to control a laser , so that can make a graffiti again , that would be awesome . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization , and a lot of things , we &apos;ve reached some things .
first , we have the <unk> the doors , and actually have a device for <unk> to get a device that he can communicate with -- a stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him <unk> , because you talk to him , or get an email , and i get an email , and i think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
also , we have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my kids and i were pulled into the garage and and these hackers and programmers and programmers and directors and <unk> have taken our house .
a lot of our friends thought that we were beautiful stupid to do that , and we would all images on the walls , and we would be <unk> .
but for over two weeks , we programmed , we went to the <unk> in venice , my children were involved , and we did this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought at the <unk> of venice , something <unk> and a few things out of the construction and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , they &apos;ve <unk> them , they put it on a <unk> , and now we have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself , we hire the code for free software , you can download free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely freely from constraints .
no insurance can &apos;t be <unk> .
no hospital too .
every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes alone or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to <unk> ward .
i love this image , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
so there &apos;s all of these <unk> from the great unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , , tony <unk> , for the first time , seven years after seven years .
and this is a amazing image , because this is his life life life system , and he &apos;s looking beyond his life support system .
we put his bed off , so he can see out .
we put a ping-pong plan against a wall of the spinal ward in front of the hospital .
and he drew again for the first time , in his family &apos;s family and friends -- and you can only imagine what kind of feeling that was in parking parking .
and also , we had to go into the parking lot , we felt like we were part of the <unk> .
and he ended up with an email with the content , &quot; for the first time for seven years , i &apos;ve drawn something .
i feel like i got stuck under water , and finally somebody came up and raised my head and i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
this is something like our <unk> .
that keeps us up and keeps us going to continue to continue .
and we need to improve a lot of this stuff .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a <unk> same .
and somebody who has a such <unk> potential deserves to make so much more .
so we &apos;re going to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve been getting all sorts of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves it .
it comes from our pockets .
so the the accolades were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then , in december , the <unk> honor of the , was one of the 50 best inventions 2010 , which was really great .
and the <unk> thing is -- and this is the whole circle -- that this april , when the <unk> <unk> in the downtown of los angeles , there is going to be a exhibition called &quot; type of the . &quot;
and there will be pretty much the toughest representatives of the <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys will be there .
<unk> is going to be part of the show , which is quite exciting .
so basically , what &apos;s is is , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , this microphone -- everything was impossible at some point .
make it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never had anything to do with <unk> , but i just took a little bit of and i surrounded myself with amazing people so that we could put something on the legs together .
and that question should be asked to ask each one of you , every single day that you have to do something that needs to be done , if not now , when , &quot; and if not me , who then ?
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably most american <unk> .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to get like a scientist .
you can have been a farmer , or in leather , but nobody ever selected farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and some .
well , a enlightenment is usually something you can find that you fall it somewhere .
you go to the block and it &apos;s as an revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you about today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who was beaten in the <unk> green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
they saved my life by using me the toilet in the <unk> .
and she did it .
she did it for three years .
and i had to get out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and i proposed to san francisco in california -- i found an lover -- and then in the back of the &apos; 80s , i thought it was a work at <unk> .
i got a call in the middle of the night about three or four years ago , and i was sent to the phone , and i said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we never know how to know each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come together with the man i know that you &apos;ve found it now .
and i should say that i have <unk> , and i want you to hurry . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew that she had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them , and we took around them , and we gave them to their family eight because it needed needed to be .
it was something that we knew .
and just as the woman who was to learn me as an adult , i was turning , she turned into a box of ash and was placed into my hands .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it was become a circle -- and the revelation that i talked about .
the revelation is , death is part of life .
she &apos;s saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that needs everything else .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is what i &apos;m talking about today .
he needs the same -- he would need to have love and delight , and it &apos;s about us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , as it rise on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a engine that &apos;s going to be <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this sounds frightening .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only person to speak to the <unk> .
so i looked at her right now , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had already <unk> the machine , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot looked at the machine after the hudson river .
this is not the route .
he switches the engines .
imagine a <unk> airplane .
and then he said three words -- the most <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> to the . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the <unk> .
i could see it in your eyes , there was horror , life was down .
i want to share with you three things that i learned about myself this day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to do a hand and didn &apos;t , all the fences i wanted to do , all the the experience i wanted to make and never do .
and while i was thinking about it later , a phrase that said , &quot; i &apos;m bad wines . &quot;
because if the wine is up and the person is there , then i open him .
i never want to make a difference in life .
and that urgency , this goal , really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and this was when we were to bridge george washington bridge , so quite around <unk> -- i thought , gee , there &apos;s one thing i really <unk> .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i think to become better in anything i &apos;m going to do .
but in my humanity , i gave me my ego .
and i &apos;m <unk> the time that i wasted for <unk> things , people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and after that , when i was thinking about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i did not have my wife with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have right ; i &apos;m guilty of being happy .
the third thing i learned -- while the inner clock was <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please <unk> into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts , as you know , to know it from documentaries .
while we &apos;re turning , i had this feeling of death , to die , not to be scary .
almost as we prepare our lives for it .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness really really itself in one thought , which is that i just one thing .
i wish i could see my children grow up .
so a month after that , i went to a performance of my daughter -- <unk> , not much <unk> talent .
... not .
and i &apos;m <unk> , i &apos;m like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made a sense for me .
i was then surprised by the time by sharing the dots that life was about being a great father .
more than everything , everything else , is my single goal in life , is a good father .
i was the miracle of being not dying that day .
i got another gift to see the future , and come back and to live different .
my call to everybody who flies today is imagine , imagine the same thing on your flight -- please -- but imagine -- but how would you change ?
what would you do doing you you would like to do , because you think you were forever there ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , are they the best parents they can be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is quite simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see here , these are <unk> .
so if we can to harness the systems that are controlling and control and control , then we can actually create a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it , a effective <unk> on a laptop that &apos;s used by a <unk> to <unk> this gray box , we &apos;re in the business .
and this is the planning behind <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> are planted into the grey box , the centrifuge and the iranian <unk> orchestra orchestra , they <unk> .
that &apos;s a piece of cake , right ?
i want to tell you how we found this .
when we started our research to <unk> six months ago , it was completely unknown what the meaning and purpose of this <unk> was .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the most dramatic part , the <unk> part , made by thousands of <unk> <unk> of mental use .
and it seemed like something <unk> , with these gray boxes , this <unk> <unk> .
so , the <unk> of our attention , and we started a <unk> project where we grew our environment with <unk> infected , and studying this research .
and then something funny happened .
<unk> was like a <unk> , who didn &apos;t like our cheese -- <unk> on it , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that made no sense in my eyes .
and after we were experimenting with various kinds of cheese , i went to realize that this is an <unk> attack .
entirely on a certain target .
the <unk> <unk> is actively on the gray box , if a special configuration was discovered , even if the special program that &apos;s trying to infect it on this destination .
and if it isn &apos;t , there &apos;s no nothing at all .
so , this really got my interest and we started working with it almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it might say , for example , we &apos;re going to say , a <unk> american power station , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should be able to figure out what the goal is .
so , <unk> and we put the code code and we found that it &apos;s <unk> in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a larger .
and also , they were very advanced , they were very advanced , from people who obviously have all the information available to the .
they knew all bits and <unk> they had to attack .
probably , they knew the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already garnered that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the <unk> are a science for themselves .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
this is a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines .
it looks pretty much like ancient <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to get smart from this code .
so what we were looking for was the first thing , because we know what this power is .
and then we went to <unk> and <unk> and trying to bring this with the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these targets that we could reveal or disprove .
so to bring these theories , we call ourselves remember that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , it must be a <unk> goal , and it &apos;s probably in iran , because most of the infections have been reported .
now , in this area there are not several thousand goals .
it &apos;s basically going out to the <unk> nuclear weapons and <unk> in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; give me a list of all the experts for <unk> and power plants from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them up and they <unk> their knowledge to compare their expertise to what we found in the code and the data .
and it worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
and the rotor line is this moving into moving inside of the centrifuge , this black object you see .
and when you manipulate the speed of this orb , you actually actually able to highlight the rotor , and eventually even to <unk> the centrifuge .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually to make it slowly and slowly , and obviously to try to get <unk> to the <unk> , so they would not be able to get behind it quickly .
the great digital <unk> -- we got a look at the by looking at data and <unk> .
so for example , the number of <unk> is a little bit out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started to academic literature , and this is what these <unk> are built in <unk> , and found that they were structured in so-called <unk> , and every <unk> contains <unk> .
so this made sense , fit it together .
and it got better .
these <unk> in iran are <unk> in the <unk> .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
so again , the fit really well together .
and this gave us great confidence for what we looked at here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s not what it was going on .
these results were done by several weeks of hard work .
and we just ran into a <unk> and had to get us new .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads are actually going to be a and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little seed takes takes a <unk> , and it <unk> the rotors and it <unk> it and the big <unk> starts with six <unk> in interactions and <unk> valves .
so , in great , and we &apos;re very confident that we &apos;ve actually sure what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry about other people that could be hit by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- has me really out of the socks .
down there is the gray box down there , and on top of you see the <unk> .
now , what this thing is is is that it &apos;s the lucy values of sensors -- so for example , <unk> and <unk> -- and there &apos;s a coded code that &apos;s still in the case of the attack , with the wrong data .
and indeed , this false data from <unk> has been recorded before .
so , it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where the <unk> is fed the <unk> with previously <unk> with <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
now , the idea of this is not only , the <unk> in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more powerful .
the idea is to cheat a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> where a human brain can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power station , for example , when the big <unk> gets too fast , you have to open up <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human embryonic .
so this is where we need digital <unk> .
and if the risk are endangered , then really bad things can happen .
the power station can explode .
and not the <unk> , the <unk> , will notice it .
this is frightening .
but it &apos;s even worse .
and now what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he &apos;s nothing to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so , for example , he would work just as well -- in a power station or in a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- when the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> over a <unk> stick , like we saw it at <unk> .
you could also use ordinary technology to spread technology .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you eventually get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the consequence that we need to confront .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they are in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most primitive environments .
we need to be able to ask the consequences , and we &apos;re starting to prepare for us .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported a lot of that people thought that the <unk> is the <unk> behind .
is it yours ?
okay , you really want to know this ?
yeah . okay .
but i think the <unk> is involved in the , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind this is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- luckily , luckily .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for having us a <unk> . thank you .
i spent the last few years trying to place situations that normally are very difficult and dangerous at the same time .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i &apos;ve filmed in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days doing nothing here -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , a little bit of a <unk> .
in fact , i &apos;ve exposed to most of my career to <unk> situations , and all of this only for trying to study social problems that they &apos;re compelling and interesting and hopefully in a way of figuring out what it &apos;s it &apos;s to the audience and the accessible .
so when i knew i would come here to look at the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i would do something a little bit different .
some of you may have heard of that a couple of weeks ago , i &apos;ve signed a display on ebay .
i sent some <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> the <unk> on my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let him buy the <unk> at the lecture you &apos;re seeing at the time not a title was not a matter of content and didn &apos;t have a lot of evidence what was going on .
so what you got was this : your name here : my tedtalk , you &apos;ve no idea what &apos;s going to be , and you can ever go to the content at the end , and you can get your company to your <unk> stupid .
but besides , it &apos;s a very good opportunity to do it .
you know how many people look at this tedtalks ?
a lot of .
this is just the <unk> .
so despite this warning , i knew anyone would buy the <unk> .
if you asked me this one year ago , i would have been able to tell you this with certainty .
but in the new project that i &apos;m working on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve been doing some pretty terrible situations over the years , but nothing was prepared for me , nothing could be prepared to me anything so difficult and as dangerous as these guys to go to a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is to film around <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; is that everything , from the up to the end , is totally with brands -- from the <unk> you &apos;ll see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center ...
these guys are going to be connected to the movie in infinity forever forever .
and so the film will study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to the hubris .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to have the brand x as a <unk> , but we &apos;ll make sure that we &apos;re going to sell any possible category in the movie .
so maybe we might sell a shoe , and he &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever worn ...
the greatest car you &apos;ve ever had is from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a attention from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of life , actually , to get them to fund the movie ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all this film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would happy to be able to do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people are going to be .
have you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use it perspective , because that &apos;s got a negative <unk> -- but you know how that &apos;s going to evolve ?
how much money is required to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth it to be some really familiar brands .
who knows when the movie comes out , we might look like a <unk> <unk> .
what do you think that the answer is going to be ?
the answer is probably not going to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing about the film or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both .
so , not that way , not so optimistic .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yeah .
if you look at people who you have to do with ...
there are some places that we can turn to .
so , imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; do you think the camera would mean , &quot; would mean that we wanted to make a <unk> ?
it turns out it was meant , &quot; we want to have nothing to do with your film . &quot;
and just as they disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
none wanted to have something to the film .
i was astonished .
they wanted to do absolutely nothing with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , to present your product as many people as possible as possible as possible as possible .
and so , in particular , in the world today , in this interface of new and old media media , is not the idea of being in this new exciting <unk> that the crowds get this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and that was what happened .
actually , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is is a problem .
you see , when you &apos;re transparency transparency at the <unk> -- this is one of the first images that appears .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
that was the problem : transparency -- <unk> deception and <unk> , just discovering and <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and , in particular , what &apos;s the last line -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re now a lot of transparency about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but if it comes to the point that it &apos;s going to be implemented , something is changed .
but why ? well transparency is fear -- like this strange bear that remains still .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s very risky also .
what else else is there ?
a whole bowl of cool food .
that &apos;s very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , and my father was going to be eating -- and he sits sitting and he looks at me and he looks at me -- he said , &quot; son , there &apos;s three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so , you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s only a company that was willing to help us -- and just because i know john bond and richard <unk> -- i found it alone , i had to do it alone , and i had to go to the <unk> and go right with my team .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking with these companies , the idea of what your brand is understood , it &apos;s a broad problem .
i have friends , the big , gigantic <unk> , and i have friends that are making little <unk> like me .
and my friends , the great , great <unk> , are saying that the reason your films are so successful , the <unk> that you have .
and then my friends , the little <unk> , are saying , &quot; well , how are we going to compete with these big , giant <unk> ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how are we going to see 12,000 in the movie ?
whenever i go to the way , and whenever i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see an <unk> .
and every time i <unk> somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you there ? you look a little nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so you might have to put a little bit of this interview before the interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
either you can &apos;t do &quot; <unk> fusion , &quot; or a &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; they &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be <unk> for men and women -- solid , <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now i can answer all of your questions and give you a <unk> .
we &apos;re smaller than a brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we as a brand a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so , things like that -- you know , reminds people of positions -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
so what words would you describe tweet ?
kanzi is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone does .
we talk about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes something positive , unlike &quot; fighting smell and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , fresh fresh , fresh fresh .
such things have a profound effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man in the street , who are like me , <unk> .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like to clothes clothes .
80s <unk> meets <unk> , except at the <unk> .
well , what &apos;s the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style i have , is probably the glamour glamour .
i like a lot of black colors , lots of <unk> and like a stuff .
but i usually have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and a stuff .
if dan was a brand , it would probably be a classic mercedes-benz of the .
the brand i &apos;m , i would say , is fly fly .
part of the day , partly insignificant , partly <unk> , part of the -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> all over the country , i &apos;ve got .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
my brand is fedex , because i was <unk> .
man 5 : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i often look at the intersection of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what happened was i needed a experts .
i needed somebody who could turn into my head , someone who really could help me understand what &apos;s called the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , helped discover these <unk> .
if they could do it for them , they could also help me .
you &apos;ve brought your pictures , yeah ?
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how this is connected to your mind and feelings about yourself .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about the world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world &apos;s own world is the world that you live in -- like people , the family , the friends , the way you live , the work and the way .
all these things came from and start from a place , and come to come to my family in west virginia .
what is the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is the idea of the mind and emotion about yourself ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are queer . i like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -- what will she do ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? what &apos;s the <unk> ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what does the red represents ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about you , not you &apos;re .
what else do you have ?
and it doesn &apos;t have to be frightened . what kind of rollercoaster do you have ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it gets out of it .
so there were a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that her <unk> two separate two , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> brand .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction to it .
and i think some companies will just focus on a strength , rather than both of them .
many companies tend to -- and that is human nature -- avoiding things that they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re scared to be scared , and they &apos;re going to turn them to be a positive , and they turn them into something positive , and that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
what other brands do we do ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it , <unk> , wii , mini , mini <unk> and <unk> .
well , there are <unk> brands and <unk> tags , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
it &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if somebody asked you to describe your <unk> , your <unk> , how would you be ?
you &apos;re a <unk> ? are you something that makes the blood in <unk> ?
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you something that little bit more exciting , more conservative , a conservative one ?
<unk> are things that are playful , fresh like the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and agile , <unk> , profane and agile , profane , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> like <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are they mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are you that , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate , like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , <unk> , safe , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and how the dalai lama or <unk> ?
over the course of the movie , we had more than 500 companies that were up and forth and they were , &quot; no , &quot; they wanted to be part of the project .
they were &apos;t have to do with this movie , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but it &apos;s found 17 <unk> that were willing to dispense with these control that were doing with someone business , and to do things like me , and that finally , to tell stories that we couldn &apos;t have said , that we couldn &apos;t have told -- stories that a <unk> would never support .
they were telling us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this film , that you use using <unk> today to make the <unk> of the brain , both to make advertising and films .
we went to sao paulo , where we had been banned .
in the entire city , for five years , there &apos;s no <unk> , no poster , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went in school school where companies are moving their way into <unk> schools , across america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback or where i had the greatest success , those are where i interacted with things directly .
and this is what these brands did .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and said that maybe the agencies don &apos;t really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artists directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people think think that we are talking about .
and how was that ? what was it ?
well , since the movie festival festival festival , we can look at this .
and according to the world &apos;s extinction , the first thing was done in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- 900 million <unk> of this film .
that &apos;s actually a period of two two weeks of actually .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film didn &apos;t get .
there is no even online . there &apos;s no <unk> .
it hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has gained a very big momentum .
and this is not bad for a project where almost every single of the world that we talked about , has followed their customers to let the finger out of it .
one of the things i believe is that when you give up your chance , you need risk that in these risks .
i think if you stop people , you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you &apos;re training your employees , you &apos;re willing to avoid the whole company to win a profit .
i feel like we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of the opportunity they might be .
finally , in the process , we should be welcome to fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
so you &apos;re welcome to fear . call the risk .
and a big spoon , we &apos;re going to say the risk .
and finally , we should be welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , a little bit of honesty is bringing us a lot .
and that &apos;s what i mean , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; welcome transparency &quot; was given to you about my good friends from <unk> , who paid $ <unk> for the <unk> for the ebay .
big data is transformed for organizations around the world in large opportunities .
<unk> presents : welcome transparency &quot; transparency
thank you .
now morgan , in the name of transparency , what &apos;s happened to the $ 10,000 <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check in my bag , put on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check in <unk> of $ <unk> to make my twin prize for the next year .
my name is <unk> .
so , 18 months ago , i was doing something different at google , and i started to do something with museums and art , my <unk> , which is now , i gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums , from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple to explain with this slide and to the access .
i grew up in india .
i was a great education -- i didn &apos;t -- i didn &apos;t -- but i had a lot of museums and this kind of work .
and then when i went and visit this museums , i started to learn a lot .
and as i was working for google , i tried to make this desire -- to make art in -- with technology .
we then set up a team , a great team , and we started this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and i &apos;ll tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you &apos;re just going to <unk> .
you can look around in all these museums .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh .
i &apos;m even entering one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you come in two ways in -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and you retire .
you want to orient in the museum ?
open the map , and take a click on it .
they &apos;re , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
just on . much fun .
think about it .
thank you , but the best one .
so i &apos;m a <unk> , a of my <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
so this is one of the images .
this is all the metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art , can click here -- but i click on this .
this is one of the images we we &apos;ve captured with the so-called <unk> .
this image , for example , has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
so here &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can very easily and <unk> .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
but then you really want to get deep inside .
and so i started playing around , and i noticed there was something going on there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , this sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close close , and i noticed that these kids actually turned something to .
i did a little bit , i was talking to some familiar with the met , and actually found that it was a game called <unk> , where a <unk> is beaten on the <unk> with a stick .
apparently , it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to go close close , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you the overview , i &apos;ll just you to see what you get .
here we were , this is the painting .
but the best part is that -- in a second .
let &apos;s jump back to the moma again , again in new york .
another <unk> of mine , <unk> .
so the previous example of the previous example , it was about picking up .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what if you want to see van gogh created this masterpiece ?
you get in . you can really go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom into one of my favorite classes until i really am in the <unk> .
this is <unk> , probably never seen this before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite feature .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing time .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
each of them , everybody -- wait a minute or poor , whether they have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and build your own museum online -- all of these images you can put your own collection .
it &apos;s simple , you go in -- and i created this , it means the power of the <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> &apos; 70s in the <unk> .
you can put all of your things with your friends , send your friends , and start with a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , to me , is the main thing that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come from google .
they &apos;re not going to think of the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from artists .
and that was a experience of me in humility .
i mean , i hope that we will be with this digital medium of art and just represent it online .
and the biggest question that i asked me recently is , &quot; did you do it to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer to that is no .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
that &apos;s what it is . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two .
that &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of every hemisphere , we could be able to represent their brain .
for example , this one , that &apos;s completely logical .
this would be someone who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you run your brain on this scale ?
some of us might have decided to do one of these extremes , but i think that for most people in the audience , your brain looks something like this -- with a high income rate that &apos;s at the same time in both .
it &apos;s not as though they both are exclusive or they &apos;re so .
they can be logical and intuitive .
and so , as one of the people , with the most innovative <unk> , who have a good component of logic to make the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to actually observe the experiments .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play with it , and then we look at it , and then we start to develop our intuition .
they basically do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably one thing can be only in a place at the same time .
i mean , it can sound funny to think that one thing at the same time is two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed it .
i remember seeing a kid playing on a <unk> .
he was another toddler , and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he was constantly falling .
but i bet that playing with the <unk> is a very valuable lesson , which is that great things don &apos;t just get over and stay in a place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , so long as they &apos;re not <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> , because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little strange particles .
and if you play with your particles , you &apos;re all kinds of weird things -- like you directly fly directly through walls , or you can be at the same time on two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the physics of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the big mundane objects around us .
that &apos;s not my intuition , and it &apos;s not just because i don &apos;t play that often with particles .
well , i &apos;m playing with them sometimes , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side has not liked it .
because if all the things are made up of particles and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , then not just all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that &apos;s not supposed to be this way .
so i would feel better with all of this thing if we could somehow show that <unk> also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so a couple of years ago , i was doing this to do this .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in the <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
here i do it a little bit . we &apos;re looking at the center right here .
and here &apos;s a really large piece of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s like a springboard , and it &apos;s above the edge .
so i made this thing in a way that makes a computer chip .
i went a clean room with new <unk> , and i was <unk> for 100 hours to all the big devices .
for the last little , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a <unk> pool of <unk> hole and get this thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the <unk> , but it takes a little bit of help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , when i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird stuff , but then i &apos;ll add other people to add and i &apos;ll hear all these things , because i don &apos;t want to fight them , or frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
so quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects are just the same .
the <unk> of objects for <unk> objects are not just humans , but the light that seems to them and the wind that goes through them over and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal to be disconnected , we had to get out all the <unk> .
and so we did .
we turned the light off , put it in a vacuum and and <unk> all the air , and it all up to almost right now , just in the elevator , was free of metal , <unk> the piece of metal , just like it wanted .
so we measured its movement .
we found it really was moving .
instead of just being there , it &apos;s <unk> . the way it was <unk> was about like this -- like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and we gave them a little push , we could put it on the same time , not to switch -- not to measure -- something that &apos;s allowed only in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m just telling you is what &apos;s truly fantastic .
what does it mean to be a object at the same time and not switch ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the <unk> of atoms from which the piece of metal is still there , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving up and down .
just to <unk> <unk> voices they agree .
they &apos;re <unk> the rest of the time .
that means that every atom at the same time is two different places , which means that the whole piece of metal is two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth me for all this year in the clean room , because , you know , the <unk> between one single atom and this piece of metal is about the same between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at two different places , can this piece of metal in two different places , why not do you ?
i mean , this is just what my logical says .
so , imagine you were in a couple of places , how would that feel ?
how would your mind be that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect in history .
when we got it , the lights lights up and the box , we saw that the piece of metal always was in a piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are actually just <unk> objects that are in a small room .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics says , it &apos;s all connected to everything .
now , that &apos;s not really right .
there &apos;s more there , it goes deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around you , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the <unk> and funny of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should be <unk> as we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about where they &apos;re going to live and work , they have given the opportunity to choose between at least one hand , different cities that all in competition by new citizens .
we &apos;re now far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries , which not even have a single city that would be welcome to
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so worth so much more than it costs them to build .
so we could do the world very easily with <unk> , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now , this may sound absurd for you , unless you &apos;ve never thought of new cities .
just trade the building from homes against cities .
imagine half the people who want to live in homes did this already , but the other half don &apos;t .
they could try to extend the capacity of existing apartments .
but you know what you were going to do to to be in these apartments and their surroundings to avoid prejudice and prevent from the <unk> .
so it turns out that &apos;s very hard to do all these these extensions .
but you could go to a whole new place , build a completely new block , the laws there would be a building like this and not <unk> it .
so i proposed that governments create new distances that provide enough space for a city , give them a name : <unk> cities .
later i found that , for example , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> have thought about the challenge of a reform in honduras .
they knew that every year around 75,000 <unk> of their land to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to ensure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in .
and this is a <unk> of <unk> said , &quot; what happens if we <unk> a <unk> area of our country , if we just go to a message of american american embassy , part of the canadian world , and if people are going to work under the canadian rules or the united states , they can work there , and can they do on the surface of these messages that they normally have to go to canada or america ? &quot;
in 2009 , in the under a fierce <unk> .
in the next presidential elections , <unk> <unk> won <unk> in a <unk> , which was both innovations and <unk> .
he challenged <unk> to become his <unk> .
in the meantime , i was prepared to talk to tedglobal .
through improvement , try and through the investigation of consumers , i &apos;ve been trying to reduce this complicated concept of the <unk> city to the most elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws , the sense that you can &apos;t be <unk> <unk> .
we pay a new technology , but we need to have a technology , but for progress , and it &apos;s common for the laws that are free to us .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala <unk> sent the link to the lecture .
and again , it showed him <unk> .
the two call me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to our country &apos;s head ! &quot;
so we met in december of a hotel in miami .
i &apos;ve been trying to make sure that we are valuable cities to how much more valuable you are than you are .
and i &apos;ve this chart to show how valuable carbon dioxide is in a place like new york , remember that a area in some cases worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was a very abstract discussion , at a point when there was a pause , it said , &quot; paul , we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so , the tedtalk said in very simple form , that a <unk> city is a place whose early <unk> land is , a <unk> , who makes the laws that are there , and people the opportunity to decide either under those rules .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of honduras who said we need to make this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way our country is going to grow .
i was asked to come to <unk> and once to keep a talk at the fourth and fifth january of january .
so i &apos;ve left another with facts that talk about , which has a graph like this , which tries to emphasize that if you want to make a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city of <unk> , and the sketch represents the new airport that was built in <unk> .
and this airport alone has a area of 100 <unk> .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the <unk> of this if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 intersections .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres .
polite have all of the <unk> .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and alert .
the leader of the congress came up and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came to the punch line that a new city gives people new opportunities .
there was a possibility of living in a city that would be in honduras instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also closes new possibilities for leaders .
the leaders of the government in honduras would be rely on the help of <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> that they would be able to support the laws of the charter and the regulations that would be able to trust that the charter is really going to be really .
and the realization of president <unk> was that the <unk> of the <unk> i thought about as a way of bringing the foreign investors and building this city could be <unk> for all parties in honduras that have been suffering and mistrust for many years .
we &apos;ve gone into an area .
this is a picture that &apos;s from this place .
it &apos;s about a thousand square kilometers .
and just after after , on january 19th , they &apos;ve voted for a change in the constitution for a change that is for special <unk> that is special for special <unk> .
in a country that was just a violent crisis , congress for this <unk> , with a voice for <unk> .
all parties , all the <unk> of the society , supported this .
but to be part of the constitution , it has to be twice by congress .
on february 17th , it was approved for the second time with <unk> to a voice .
immediately after this election , between the 21st and the 24th , february , a delegation of about 30 <unk> to the two places in the world that were most interested in the the store of the <unk> .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large new city , built in south korea , built in <unk> as the urban <unk> .
all you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the permits .
the other place that was very interested in the urbanism is singapore .
it has already built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re virtually to think about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a <unk> ; they &apos;re already <unk> this area for the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a system system that allows <unk> to participate , and it &apos;s also working on a external system .
a country already has offered his supreme court to provide the court for the <unk> appeal of the <unk> system .
and also <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even bring funding to fund .
one thing you already know , was already done , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there are many of the businesses that would like to be in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who would like to live there .
around the world , there are 700 million people who are saying they want to live in another place .
a million people left a year of latin america and migrate to the united states .
many of you are <unk> who are forced to walk their families , and sometimes work on <unk> , sometimes there are single mothers who have to earn enough money to eat and eat .
unfortunately , sometimes sometimes , sometimes kids trying to find their parents , they , in some cases , haven &apos;t seen anything for a decade .
so what is it an idea of thinking about , in , , is it a completely new city ?
or even building blocks of these cities , or are there hundreds of around the world ?
so what is it that you &apos;re an idea of making that every family has a choice between the cities that are in competition for new citizens ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
my friends from honduras , asked me to say thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions they make on a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i recently did a survey of 2,000 americans recently , and the average number of choices that a typical american woman does is a typical american .
recently , a study was done with ceos in which they saw the ceos for a week .
and these scientists just documented the different issues with which that ceo was engaging on , and how much time they spent spent decisions with the issues that deal with the issues .
and they found that a average ceo was busy working on the week with <unk> tasks .
each of these issues made of course , many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions , they needed an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions they meet in the nine minutes of category meeting , in one hour ?
how good do you think you &apos;re in doing this ?
today i want to talk about one of the largest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise it because i &apos;m blind , just the hand , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , well , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a college student at stanford university , i went to this very <unk> <unk> , at least at the time he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually had <unk> .
i loved to go to this business , but at one point i asked myself , well , how &apos;s it that you never ever get something ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had over 75 different kinds of oil , including those those who were locked in boxes that came from a thousand years old .
so i one day i decided to go to the prison , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model work that you really offer people all these options ? &quot;
and he pointed out the <unk> of tourists who came every day and they used their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s her <unk> gait .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we &apos;ve put a little <unk> right right on the entrance of the <unk> .
we put six different flavors of dna , or 24 different tastes , <unk> , and we looked at two things : first , i guess what case would more people stay and stay <unk> ?
there are more people stuck when it was 24 , about 60 percent than if it was six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we looked at what people were doing more like a glass of <unk> .
now we saw the effect effect .
of the people who stayed on the when there were 24 , only three percent bought a jar of <unk> .
of the people who stayed on the than six , now we saw that 30 percent of you bought a jar of <unk> .
now , if you calculate it , people would be a glass of six times a glass that they had six to choice than if they had 24 to the selection .
now , not making a glass of <unk> is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the <unk> is also affecting us in very <unk> decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even though it &apos;s about our best interests .
so the theme of the day , financial savings .
i &apos;m going to show you a study that i was using with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who we were to <unk> decisions for saving nearly a million americans from about a million americans in the entire united states .
and what we were looking at was whether the number of <unk> that could be a <unk> , the <unk> plan , the probability of whether more would be more tomorrow tomorrow .
and what we found was that there was a connection .
so in this plans , we had about <unk> plans that people have taken to to the people between two to 60 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund have been offered that , in fact , participation was low .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans that were having two fund , a <unk> in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that <unk> almost 60 dollars , the <unk> now fell about the <unk> .
now it turns out even if you were to <unk> , if you were able to choose to choice , even then negative consequences .
so the people who decided decided to come out with the more opportunities they have , the more they would fund them and choose the fund .
the more opportunities they were available , the more they put their money in pure <unk> .
none of these extreme decisions , you to the decisions that someone would recommend from people if we &apos;re important in their future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences that provide more and more choices to
they push the decision -- push them , even when they &apos;re their own best .
they make more more poorer decisions -- bad financial and poorer medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to be able to make them less comfortable , even if they make it better objective .
the main reason that we think we might enjoy these huge shelves of <unk> , mustard , <unk> and <unk> , but we don &apos;t really have the compare and enter the <unk> and then actually make something out of the fabulous offer .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and testing different types of technologies -- that you can just use in your business .
first , just .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true to be true today that less .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; change . &quot;
they always make a worry about losing food .
but in truth , we see more and more and more that if you &apos;re ready to get out and get the <unk> of opportunities , well , there &apos;s a increase of sales , it will cost to cost , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s a improvement in the <unk> .
as a cross-country skier and <unk> the different <unk> and <unk> kinds of 26 to 15 , they experienced a increase of sales by 10 percent .
when the golden <unk> corporation gave her 10 10 on the worst <unk> , she experienced that the profit by 87 percent <unk> -- a result of both of the sales and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average <unk> today , you &apos;re giving you 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart is giving you 100,000 products today .
but the <unk> supermarket , who &apos;s now <unk> supermarket supermarket in the world today , and they &apos;re giving them only 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce .
now in the world of <unk> , i think one of the best examples that came to the market recently about how best the choice was , was something that david <unk> has very strong on , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
every single harvard employees now takes up automatically in a <unk> part .
those who really want to make a choice will be offered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know , people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to tell it .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different .
and if your employees can &apos;t get them , they can &apos;t do their clients . &quot;
now , before we started today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer a <unk> of <unk> holidays to the most beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read you that .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read and and then i ask you to clap , if you &apos;re willing to take gary &apos;s service .
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to embrace gary &apos;s offer .
are all all ?
well , let me show you a little bit more of it .
and you knew it was a trick , right ?
now , who is ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve probably heard more hands .
good .
in fact , that &apos;s what you consider , the first time , had more information than the second time , but i would to guess that it was a second time to think it was real .
because the images would be thought to be real .
which brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of the problem of the problem , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between the possibility of the difference of the difference with the individual possibilities , and that that consequences have to be felt and <unk> and <unk> .
why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more if they &apos;re using a <unk> or a card card than they &apos;re on cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel like we &apos;re going to make money .
and it turns out that if you make something to , it feels a very good tool to get people to save more .
so we have a study that i did with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we did a study with people at <unk> -- employees who worked all the <unk> -- and these people were all in a gathering where they had their participation for their <unk> .
and during this meeting , we &apos;ve just just the meeting as it was always , just as it was , we added a little bit of a .
the little thing that we added up to is that we asked people to think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they were saving money .
in that simple thing , we did , there was a increase of participation by 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or a increase by four percent in the amount they were willing to pay for the <unk> .
third technology : <unk> .
we can better with more categories than more choices .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we did in a <unk> .
it turns out that in the <unk> <unk> , the northeast , the northeast , the number of <unk> , the number of <unk> , the number of magazines that <unk> had to <unk> magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazine and you show them in 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you two in 20 categories , then you think i gave you more choices and a better <unk> , when i gave you the 400 , when i gave you the 600 .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different <unk> .
it &apos;s called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; jazz . &quot;
if you think that the left display is <unk> and the display on the right is , you clap into your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that on the left is jazz , and that &apos;s the one on the right is <unk> , please clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a highly <unk> <unk> .
the categories have to say something about the <unk> , not to give them the selection .
and this problem is often , if you look at the long lists of all these fund .
who are you really trying to sign out ?
my fourth technology : questioning for complexity .
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to increase complexity .
let me show you one example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s an german <unk> , which gives you the ability to <unk> your car completely yourself .
they have to make 62 different decisions to design their car completely .
now these decisions are the number of choices that they offer to offer to a decision .
<unk> , the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
so what i do now is i change the order of the choices .
half of the customers will go from the many ways , 56 <unk> to the low possibilities , four different .
the other half of customers are going to the low possibilities , four different , , to the <unk> , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how interests you are .
if you &apos;re constantly using the <unk> decision , it means that you &apos;re being overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m going to get you .
what you find is that the people who are going from the many people to the low <unk> are going to vote over and over again .
we &apos;re losing them .
go from the little choices to the many , you stay on the front of it .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order of that information .
when i start with the simple , i learn how to do .
even though the gears choose , nothing to me about my preferences in the interiors , it still makes me choose to choose .
and i &apos;m also in a lot of the big product that i &apos;m going to do , and so i &apos;m willing to get myself to be with interest .
let me wrap it up .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that address the problem of <unk> -- -- you &apos;re going to get the <unk> alternatives ; <unk> -- do it real ; categorize it -- we can handle better categories , less opportunities ; on complexity .
every one of those techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you manage the possibility -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people they offer service .
because i think the key to best choice is that you &apos;re in choice .
and the more we pick the choose , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> at youtube . i &apos;m looking at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how video games are going to be , and then , why it &apos;s important to do .
we all want to be star -- celebrities , singer , comedians -- when i was young , that seemed so much .
but <unk> have allowed us to be <unk> , or all our creative activities , be truly toxic in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous on the internet to the next saturday .
but at youtube , more than 48 hours of video will uploaded to
and again , only one tiny percentage ever will ever <unk> and will look at thousands of times and so on the cultural moment .
so how does that work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> <unk> this video he filmed in front of his house in the yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this chart shows what what it was like , the the first time , the video was popular .
actually , <unk> didn &apos;t want to do viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing this , you &apos;re going to be a mountain mountain .
he had a lot of <unk> uploaded .
and this video was actually sent to the in january .
what happened here ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet that made the video so popular .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> are asking us new and interesting things , and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> &apos;s <unk> on <unk> . <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> . <unk> &apos; <unk> . <unk> &apos; em on <unk> . you didn &apos;t think we &apos;d going to conversation about this conversation without talking about this video .
rebecca <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
this year , almost 200 million times this year .
this is what the graph looked like .
like the &quot; double raindrop &quot; it seems like it &apos;s not come from the .
what happened to day ?
well , it was friday , it &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other tips are <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> it up , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson <unk> was a first one who was a <unk> about a little bit of a joke about twitter .
the importance is that a individual or group of <unk> would take a position to come up with a big audience and thereby bring the process accelerated .
then this community of people gathered together who shared this big <unk> , and started talking about it and started playing with it .
now there are 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; at youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a spoof for every single day .
unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century , participation of the community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by making it spread or something new from it .
&quot; <unk> <unk> is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year , it was nearly 50 million times .
and if you think that crazy , you &apos;d know that there was a <unk> that was been seen four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that is in the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> .
there was uncertainty .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole <unk> farm farm , from the ground that made it from a dumb joke to something we all participate in .
we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something we do .
who could have shut this up ?
who could have predicted &quot; double black or rebecca <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> black &quot; or &quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
what <unk> of the could you write in which this <unk> ?
in a world where every minute of video is uploaded to two days , only unique and unexpected <unk> like the names of video .
i admit i wasn &apos;t very interested in when a friend said i was speaking to this great video , a fellow who was facing this great video about a fellow who was protesting for <unk> for bicycles .
i got a traffic ticket because i &apos;m not going to go to the <unk> , but often there are disabilities that don &apos;t let a ride ride on the <unk> .
because that was completely surprising and humorous , and casey was wonderful <unk> , and his argument was five million times .
this approach is true of new things we &apos;re creative .
and all of this leads to the one big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new media and culture , which everybody has access to and the audience in the audience .
as i said , one of the most famous stars -- justin bieber -- did his beginning at youtube .
nobody needs to give up your ideas .
and today we all feel like the owners of our popular culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re not hitting the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the family between women about three generations , and how amazing strength of these interconnectedness in a four-year-old girl , when she was 30 years old , her mother and her grandmother , sitting in a small boat in the chinese ocean . an interconnection that was stuck in life in this little girl <unk> <unk> and never disappeared in the life of this little girl , living in san francisco and today on her today ?
the story is not over yet .
it &apos;s an puzzle that &apos;s still being compiled .
i want to tell you about some of the most <unk> .
so , imagine the first piece : a guy who burn his life &apos;s life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose entire life of the simple hope of oneness and freedom of his home .
and imagine if you were in <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> , how he must be aware that his life had been a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , <unk> now his .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broke through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
i had to make sure that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn to learn that the story was not to us to <unk> us , but we did it .
the next <unk> show , like a boat in early early <unk> , was quiet on sea .
my mother may be 18 when her father died -- already in a <unk> marriage , with two little girls .
for her , life had set her a task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely clear that she could fail .
after a four-year-old and <unk> <unk> <unk> , a boat would bury the lake as <unk> .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear they had was they were <unk> , rape and death .
as most adults on the boat , my mother wore a little <unk> .
and with a <unk> , my sister and i would have had my grandmother , and i &apos;d draw it .
my first memories are from this boat -- the <unk> <unk> of the engine , the clapping of a wave on the bug , the large and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates who came to the <unk> , but i had <unk> from the men &apos;s <unk> on our boat , or on the engine of the motors that six hours didn &apos;t want to start .
but i remember the lights of the <unk> from the coast of the coast , and the young man who was walking around and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first <unk> that i had one of the men on the platform .
no apple ever pushed it again .
after three months in a refugee camp we landed in melbourne .
and the next thing is about four women in three generations , and they &apos;re building a new life together .
we were left in <unk> , one of the most sophisticated insights that we have made of <unk> .
in other ways , in the <unk> , whose existence was completely unknown , there was no <unk> in <unk> .
the smells of the <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> broken <unk> were separated between people who had one thing in common : they started fresh .
my mother worked on farms , then on a <unk> jar , six days , six layers .
it somehow , you could find the time to find english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every dollar was assigned , and was put in more training for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do for it , and the new things that came up with was the female hand .
two two main girls for school , each one to cover the holes in the other .
one <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to pass six years .
and there were the rare <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and here and there and there , &quot; <unk> , go home . &quot;
where ?
something more profound in me .
there was a meeting meeting , and a calm voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to get out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept at the same bed .
my mother was every night , but we told each other from our day , and we heard the movements of our grandmother &apos;s movements .
my mother suffered from <unk> from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until their <unk> came to come to the <unk> .
she was a <unk> , then she took a <unk> and she was a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who didn &apos;t change the change , angry and <unk> , and <unk> children , including between two worlds .
loans and donors were been .
spiders were established .
i lived in <unk> .
in one , i was the classic asian student , who was <unk> demands of himself .
in the other i was involved in insecure life , the tragic scars of violence , the <unk> and the remote .
but there were so many people who were helping .
and i was in my last year of <unk> , i was <unk> as a young <unk> of the year .
and i was taken from one <unk> to the next , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , <unk> <unk> from <unk> , was now tan , refugee and social activist who invited to miami to places that she never heard of , and in housing that she never had imagined imagined .
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go to routine and the comfort of life of a unknown <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who were each of their days , as they were 20 years , by telling each other the stories of their day and <unk> , we still still at the same bed .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was as old as she was when we had the boat .
no , no one had ever been a way .
&quot; do it easy , &quot; she said , &quot; and not , you don &apos;t . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and training , and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the more i spoke , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , living at the limits of possible .
and even though i had graduated , i realized that i could not go to a career in school .
there had to be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a <unk> , new in the picture -- and not just okay , but something you have to grateful for , maybe a gift of the <unk> .
because <unk> can be so easily to collapse the horizons , so easily means that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve gone out of my school school to know that , yes , the world , but not like how to do it .
the possibility that would have been been done was explicitly encouraged .
there was a energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange <unk> of the humility and the <unk> .
so i followed my gut .
i collected a little team of people around me , for the <unk> , &quot; not a challenge challenge .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a dime .
at the end of every day , i received a huge amount of electromagnetic soup that we shared .
we worked until late to night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were some brilliant things , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to move into the united states .
there &apos;s only one journey there .
my gut again .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure went on .
before i go back the talk , i &apos;d like to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up in a time when the social norm , and the local government was the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died soon after her birth .
her mother was alone her alone .
at 17 , she was the second woman who was her mother .
without a man &apos;s support , she was <unk> for a <unk> , bringing it to trial and <unk> her in her own case , and she had a bigger <unk> than she won .
&quot; don &apos;t get that <unk> .
i just <unk> in a hotel in sydney when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> and and i saw them standing on the other side .
i knew she had come to go out .
my mother called me up a few minutes later .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around their coffin .
we told her stories and she <unk> her , that we were still .
by the monk , the monk came and said he had to close the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch their hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she &apos;s been to tomorrow , &quot; he said .
&quot; you haven &apos;t prepared it . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s the women .
if you see who we were and how life life has formed us , we can now see that the men who might come into our lives , would have come to the <unk> .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i think i &apos;d be on the boat .
who would ever be one ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , in front of the , before <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the brave one wave of wave , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of the engine , the vast horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give it to me and i could make it safe , i would do it .
and also , mother &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all photography at all ?
because of course , this is a picture you can &apos;t take on with your camera .
and yet , my interest in photography began when i first got my first digital digital camera at age 15 .
i put it with my former predilection for drawing , but it was a little different , because using the camera was the process in planning .
and if you take a picture of a camera , the process ends up when you &apos;re on the trigger .
so for me , photography seemed more like to go to the right place at the right time .
i believed everybody could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts when the trigger is .
photographs like this : a construction site along a much more <unk> road .
but it has a unexpected twist .
and it &apos;s a realistic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and <unk> , but all of the purpose to keep the highest level .
when i say reality , i &apos;m <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i always want to let it look like you could have that , on a photo .
photos where you have to think about a moment to find out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about catching an idea than really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
and sometimes the illusion is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made to a two-dimensional area .
it &apos;s not about what realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put together together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfectly printed physical objects that we can all identify with in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , combined , you can create something that still looks three-dimensional , as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that &apos;s not possible .
so we we our brains , because our brains don &apos;t really make sense that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in the photographs of photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture realistic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because they just look wrong .
so i would say there are three simple rules to follow a <unk> outcome .
and you can see , these are not three special images .
but but can can make something special like this .
so the first rule is that ordinary men should have the same perspective .
secondly , supposedly , ordinary photos have the same thing .
and these two images are supporting these two specs -- from the same altitude , and the same <unk> .
third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to tell where the individual pictures start and end them together by connecting them seamlessly .
it &apos;s impossible to say , how the photograph actually was put together .
so by using color , contrast and brightness on the edge of the individual images , 37 broken links , like <unk> , <unk> colors and interference , we &apos;re the limit between the different images and and let &apos;s look like a single photograph , although a picture can basically contain hundreds of layers .
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that &apos;s just an landscape , and the bottom part was manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely composed of photographs of different places .
i personally believe that it &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise up with the ideas in your head .
but it takes a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan to do the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on a <unk> .
the bank is from another place .
the <unk> is from a quarry .
and yes , i even the house up on the island of red , to make it look like dogs .
so to get a <unk> outcome , i &apos;m going to go out of my .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a very good time planned .
and if you do good images , the outcome can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing we &apos;re about is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> trusses .
and i think the most important point about this is that we stopped talking with our patients .
and one of the things we introduced at the <unk> was to take a <unk> .
they don &apos;t think of it in particular -- she puts a cup of coffee or tea , and asks the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how about it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main reasons why everybody -- maybe most of the electronic <unk> categories : because we stopped listening .
this is my favorite one . this is a very simple thing .
she has a button , it &apos;s up .
and every morning i &apos;ll it .
and yeah , i have a job as you might recognize .
i have my job at 95 lbs .
it &apos;s very simple : every time i go to the scale , you &apos;ll send my data to google health .
and there they &apos;re going to be from my <unk> , so that can see where my favorite is is , not just the moment where i need a <unk> or or need , but also with a view of the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you might know that , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i &apos;m going to go to my <unk> and people already talk to me before i sit in the car , &quot; i want to just a little salad today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> thing that can happen , because this is the <unk> , <unk> to help patients , because that could be used for obesity , or it could be the smoking for the .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and to bring them to play any kind of game , to better control their health .
at the next week , it &apos;s coming up the market .
there will be this little <unk> that you &apos;re going to be a iphone or something .
and it &apos;s going to allow people to measure their blood pressure from home , send it to their doctor , share for for for something more than 100 dollars .
at that point , patients come in . they can &apos;t only take control of control , captain on their own ship , but can also help us health of the challenges that are ahead of us , and the <unk> of health , double demand , and so on .
make the methods that are easy to use , and start to hug patients in the team .
and they can do that through these sorts of techniques , but also by <unk> .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we all have <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all the atms around the world are located .
we know one another , where all the stations are .
and sure , we can find <unk> .
but where would the nearest <unk> to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew .
no one knew where to find the next life-saving <unk> in that moment .
so , what did we do ? we did crowdsource in the netherlands .
we &apos;ve built a website and a <unk> morality , &quot; when you see a <unk> , please share us where he is when he &apos;s when he &apos;s , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , of course , of course ,
and over 10,000 <unk> were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
and we &apos;ve created a 3d design .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , augmented reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and somebody will collapse , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , you can also have your <unk> to find the next <unk> that can save life .
and now , we don &apos;t just want to do this as a <unk> , as the product is called , but also as a <unk> .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , by other universities , to help us behave like <unk> , to bring these <unk> around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and somebody else will come , if it &apos;s your own balance or or somebody else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask is , companies around the world are helping us to the <unk> of these <unk> ?
they could be <unk> , or technicians , for example , to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still in its place .
please help us and try and make health not just do something but take it to your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little <unk> wants us to force the environment by making ...
... it &apos;s the <unk> intrinsic for .
here &apos;s a short video of what we &apos;re doing .
oh . a moment .
it may take it until it &apos;s been <unk> .
now -- we can just skip this up -- i &apos;ll just put the video up ...
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> ...
oh , my time is gone ?
okay . thank you .
so a couple of years ago i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to work a year and work in an environment that &apos;s pretty much everything they hate , we have them in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a bit like the <unk> for geeks .
we take a lot of fellows every year , and we let them work with <unk> .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them to <unk> .
and they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what they really do is show what &apos;s possible with technology today .
so they &apos;re going to meet al .
al is a <unk> in the town of boston .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really looking for is someone who <unk> him when he knows he &apos;s not very good at the <unk> when he &apos;s <unk> by a feet .
how did he get looking for this particular kind of
we had a team of people last year in boston , the code for america .
they were there in february , and it was a lot of <unk> .
and they realized that the city never <unk> the fire hydrant .
but a particular fellow , a guy named erik <unk> , was there was something else , and that was that the residents were the sidewalks to the <unk> , right before those parts .
so he did what every good developers would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you &apos;re <unk> to <unk> , if it &apos;s <unk> .
if you do that , you can give it a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a humble little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the people have written last year .
but she does something that no other <unk> does .
it &apos;s expanding fast .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> <unk> of the city , who saw that he could use this app , not for snow , but to the citizens of <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these if-then rewards work , but people steal batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to clean the citizens to clean the <unk> .
and chicago has just introduced to the people who are <unk> the <unk> when it &apos;s <unk> .
we now know nine cities that plan to use these app .
and she &apos;s <unk> , organic , of course .
if you know about <unk> , you don &apos;t usually know that it &apos;s not going to go .
the software of software takes a few years .
we had a team that worked last year on a project that was working on a project for three people .
it was about a way of a way to the parents that the the right public schools for their children .
we were later told that if it would go over normal channels , it would have taken over two years and it would have cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not even .
there &apos;s a project right now in california , which is that the taxpayer has cost two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then it &apos;s spreading from <unk> , is a kind of <unk> in front of the government .
she shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , how many people think it should be .
and not just like a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , this app is that it represents a new generation that is addressing the problem of government -- not as the problem of a <unk> institution but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at doing with digital design .
there &apos;s now a big community of people making the tools that we need to do things together .
it &apos;s not just code for america , &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people across the country who are up and writing , writing everyday in their own communities every day .
they didn &apos;t give the government .
they they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but she didn &apos;t complain about it , she fix her .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all forget about your feelings about politics and the line at the time , and you forget about the other things that we really get excited about is government , in the essence of tim o <unk> , &quot; what we &apos;re doing in common , that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people gave up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;m going to ask you to think about it because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government ultimately feeds their force -- <unk> you , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and like many people , i thought that the government is mainly about choosing people into a office .
so after two years , i &apos;ve come to conclusion that it &apos;s mainly in fact , in fact , to get a <unk> .
this is the <unk> service service and information .
and you typically get out of the time when you &apos;re in your city .
if you ever have the chance to work in your <unk> center , like our fellow scott <unk> , in part of the program -- in fact , do that all -- you &apos;ll see that people , call government because of many different problems , including that a <unk> in your house .
so scott gets this <unk> .
he might &quot; <unk> &quot; into the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but it wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
and boston is not just a call .
it has an app , a <unk> and a <unk> , called the <unk> <unk> .
we didn &apos;t write the app .
this is the work of very smart people in the office of the new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is a real report -- this is what it said , &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t tell whether it &apos;s dead .
how do i get them removed ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; <unk> <unk> is different .
scott <unk> from human to human .
but &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; everything is public , so everyone can see it .
and in this case , it was a neighbor .
and the next post we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ? <unk> .
turned the <unk> on the side . went home .
good night , cute <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital world .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is going to get into this .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform here .
i &apos;m more more about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizens helped another citizen , but the government was playing a central role here .
she connected these two people .
and if would have combined them with government services if they needed it , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor &apos;s wishes , we strengthen our communities .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they think that &apos;s one of the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is the .
how often have we chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and we expect back to the government , and we expect the government to move our values and have our needs , and then not much changed ?
that &apos;s because the government is like a <unk> ocean and politics is the top <unk> .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt , the thing that we own , and for which we pay for , that we &apos;re working on , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy .
because this is where the actual <unk> is happening .
we need to get to the government &apos;s machinery .
so the <unk> has done it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of <unk> citizen who wrote a very detailed <unk> report that an answer to the <unk> about the <unk> .
this is not political active , it &apos;s <unk> active .
now , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time we we think about the world we want to leave with our children .
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges they have to ask .
do we really believe that we have to reach what we need to do without the institution that can act in the name of all of us ?
one government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is technology makes it possible to fundamentally the function of government , in a way that can actually achieve something by connecting society .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up the internet internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build really systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with her voice , for granted .
they don &apos;t fight this battle that we all fight fighting to talk about who &apos;s to speak ; they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
they can express their opinion , on every channel at every time , and they do it .
so , when you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care so much about using their voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve government &apos;s work .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be a fire hydrant , <unk> <unk> , a trash of a trash .
and sure enough , we could have these constellations of all of the time , and many people do .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers government , who are paying taxes and sharing .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we will not improve government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all for you : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , everyone together , will we be just a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands too ?
thank you .
and my role in explaining people explain how wonderful the new technologies that are at the , are going to be , and i &apos;m , because i am here , i &apos;m going to see what i really think , and also trying to understand what &apos;s going on with these incredible interfaces that happened so quickly that we can &apos;t keep up with .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you a single boring slide .
... you could just show the slide .
this is a slide i picked up from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide here , but rather the general shape .
this is a slide of a analysis of a analysis of a <unk> of <unk> processors compared to the performance of a <unk> area .
now the interesting thing here is that this slide , as many other , which we often find in our field , is a kind of a curve curve .
in other words , every one here is equivalent to a potency in the <unk> .
and this is a novelty that we need to use this type of scale on the <unk> of technology .
something very strange happens here .
so this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
so if you could turn the light back .
another bit more , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper right here .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology on <unk> curves ?
and the reason for that is that if i draw it on a regular curve , where , say , this is the years , the timeline of a kind , and this is a random bit of the technology that i want to pose with a graph , the graph will be silly .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
so if i want to record another technology , we &apos;ll say a <unk> , then that would be very <unk> in the scale of a flat line , in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this happens , it changes the <unk> conditions .
so if the <unk> of the speed of the <unk> would be <unk> , then we could get <unk> into a taxi and 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not fast .
this was never before in the history of <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , which is the the <unk> increase all the years of the .
and the question i want to ask you about is , if you look at these exponential curves , you can &apos;t go to go forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything forever , forever , it &apos;s expanding as fast as it is now .
there are two options .
it &apos;s either going to be a classic <unk> like this , until something completely new to this , or it will happen here .
that &apos;s it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think this is what &apos;s going to happen here .
it &apos;s really , then , means we &apos;re in a transition right now in a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world , to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i often ask myself , is this a new world ?
what is this new state that the world is starting to do ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle of the world .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still 2,000 .
we keep going on .
so in other words , the future every year , the future of surviving has been around a year .
and i think the reason is that we know something is happening .
the transition happens . we can feel it all .
and we know that at currently , it &apos;s simply no sense to try to look at 30 or 50 years , because everything is so different from that a simple <unk> of what we &apos;re doing now not doing sense .
so i want to talk about this , this is what we &apos;re going to be in .
to do this first , i &apos;ll first talk about some other things that really nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think really understand that we need to really understand back , and we need to look at this on a longer period of time .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at on the <unk> of life .
i think the big picture makes sense if you squeeze it into some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.5 billion years , the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with lots of chemicals that were uploaded to
now if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they <unk> the .
i also think there are theories starting to understand how everything started rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a quick story about that , that at this time , little <unk> <unk> , which kinds of <unk> of chemicals .
some of these <unk> were a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate different chemicals from the outside and grow up .
all of them were , they started to .
these little <unk> were the <unk> <unk> .
but , in fact , these <unk> were not about alive in the sense , because each one of them was just a small , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , the <unk> of chemicals have <unk> into the disparate amounts of
so every <unk> was a little different .
in fact , the production rate , which was one for the growth of the agricultural composition had faster than others and integrated more chemicals from the outside , and faster and faster .
so this threshold of population is to survive longer and and it &apos;s in <unk> in .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if this <unk> taught a trick about abstraction .
so in some way , we can &apos;t quite understand , these <unk> have the ability to have the ability to <unk> information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , in a particular chemical shape that we call dna .
in other words , they found a way in this <unk> , evolutionary way , which allowed them to make what they were doing , and they had <unk> that information could be saved and copied .
and the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is about the time of 2.5 billion years that it came in , right now .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from the exact same code and the same notation .
and each organism is the exact same letters and same code .
we are so far that we can write only the <unk> , just to the <unk> .
and i &apos;ve got 100 <unk> of a white <unk> , which i try to keep in airports from <unk> <unk> .
and inside is -- what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use to the <unk> -- and i wrote my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if someone wants to put a hundred million copies of my obituary , i have enough for everyone in this room and even everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was actually a <unk> , i would have written it on a virus and put it in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna of dna dna was a interesting step .
and the <unk> these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and that started to communicate these cells and exchange information , so that communities were born from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew it , but bacteria can actually exchange your dna .
that &apos;s why the reason why it &apos;s growing to antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how to stay from penicillin and have written this information together with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate . each other .
now these communication are now allowing the to of communities that were in a way in a way that were in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they either survived , or they were running together , which meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals in the community were more more more and more and by evolution .
the <unk> is now where these communities are so close to the fact that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into a <unk> .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at this point we have <unk> communities , communities of many <unk> <unk> , who are together as single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re such a selfish community .
we have lots of cells that are no longer asking themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells , so on .
so these communities started to evolve so that the level of evolution was happening , no longer was the individual cell , but the whole <unk> that we call the organism .
the next step now happened within these communities .
the <unk> started to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures that were nothing else to process as information within the organism .
and these are neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> that they &apos;ve built up these these <unk> .
they started to train specialists within the community , particular structures that were responsible for learning and understanding information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point an individual -- learning happened now within the period of time period of a single organism , rather than these evolutionary period .
so an organism could learn to eat a particular fruit , not eating a particular fruit , because they were laughing and sick , the last time it ate it .
now , this could happen within the lifespan of a individual organism , whereas that was needed for hundreds of thousands of years , because this information had to be learned from the individuals that died because of these <unk> , because these hadn &apos;t been there .
so the nervous system has pioneered the <unk> of this particular <unk> because evolution could now within a single place .
she could take a <unk> in a <unk> .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
once , as example , the <unk> version of this <unk> is the human language .
it &apos;s a quite amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and nasty idea in my head .
i &apos;m here , and i &apos;m basically basically <unk> sound of me , hoping to create a similar idea in your head that has a certain resemblance to my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , we turn it in sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the minds of others .
so this is what we &apos;re going to allow us to do again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , humanity , is , we started to abstract .
we &apos;re going to run the same steps that have been through the <unk> -- the abstraction of our methods that we put on the data , we present .
so the invention of the language was a little step in this direction .
so , computer computers , computer , <unk> , <unk> , and so on , all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to make this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also able to develop faster than we &apos;ve been .
so nowadays , evolution can happen in the period of microseconds .
you also saw <unk> little <unk> , which is a little bit of evolution in the <unk> &quot; program , right in front of your eyes .
so we &apos;ve got the <unk> again .
the first steps of history i told you about , <unk> a billion years a piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , <unk> a few hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , <unk> less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be a few decades .
the process feeds itself and becomes , i think , <unk> is the word for that -- when something gets more <unk> .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that feed itself .
i live living professionally from building computers , and i know that i &apos;m the mechanism that i &apos;m using to use computers , not using the recently , in the computer computer .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in traditional traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor does in the <unk> .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what designers of thinking <unk> is , we think about a <unk> , <unk> this machine , and the machine makes something that makes our ability far beyond , better and faster than we could ever do .
and it does it in part of the techniques that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
one way that &apos;s particularly interesting , and that &apos;s a lot of time i &apos;ve been used recently , is evolution itself .
and we &apos;re putting a <unk> in the machine that &apos;s going on in the <unk> .
so to give an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s made of random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> , would be a hundred million randomly chosen sequences of instructions .
now , please get all these random chosen instructions , take all the programs , and eventually eventually the ones that are closest to the next . &quot;
so in other words , i &apos;m trying to figure out what i want .
let &apos;s say i want to go up with numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve used for it .
so , the programs that can rank on the most precious numbers .
and of course , the chance of randomly chosen instructions is very small , that by accident , they &apos;re just going to be able to do numbers , so i don &apos;t probably have the instructions to do this .
but one of those likes with something about two numbers in the right order .
now i &apos;m saying , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of sequences that have come my next few .
remove this , <unk> the rest .
now , all the <unk> that have the numbers best .
and with a method of <unk> , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they make children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the kids <unk> the properties of the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that have come closer to the other than others .
say , &quot; repeat this process . &quot;
get it back .
now , some mutations are .
and try and do this again with another generation .
all of generations only need few milliseconds .
and so i can go through a evolution over millions of years in the computer in a few minutes , or a few hours .
finally , i get programs that can be able to rank numbers perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write from hand .
so if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s tempting and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure that they &apos;re doing the job , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that have done the job .
because their lives depended on whether they made the job right .
i sat down in a 747 with marvin <unk> , he <unk> a map and he says , &quot; look . look at this .
there &apos;s this airplane from <unk> <unk> , which together to work on their flight , and does &apos;t you bother ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> is not optimal when it &apos;s too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers , a process that is very different from classical biological engineering .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the possibilities of it .
so let &apos;s <unk> technology .
so we &apos;re using these programs to make the computers much faster , so we can be able to do these processes even faster .
so it &apos;s a <unk> .
it &apos;s going to be faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies today are feeding themselves .
we &apos;re up .
we &apos;ve got at a point that &apos;s analog to the time , when we evolved to be <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t quite make the idea that the hell of the hell here is actually the way .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really believe that after us , something is coming to us .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> to tell us that we are the end of evolution .
and i think we all here are part of the creation of what &apos;s going to happen next .
well , the lunch is before , and i think i &apos;ll stop here before i get even more .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the <unk> of the desert with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about that there hasn &apos;t changed since the ancient indian <unk> of the ancient indian &quot;
if we wanted indians to go to the back , we would go into a car and shoot over the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
back then , when the great indian <unk> had <unk> <unk> , he took a bow , put it into the ground and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that really made me sad .
i was a little freaked out technology .
it was me fear that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without camera and without tweet for my friends .
i found technology should be magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most terrifying thing for me .
it became a <unk> access to a world full of pirates and <unk> ships and images in my imagination .
i thought , it was like holding our fancy clocks and <unk> of them .
they kept us from being inspired by the .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use them to make magic rather than killing .
16 16 i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling , the readers can connect around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s getting pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
the storytelling is always taking a lot of sense .
but what do we do with it ?
i &apos;m just going to go to <unk> , an interactive ipad app .
here says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here says , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to figure out a character in the book .
and a letter falls down to me -- and the ipad knows , by gps , where i live -- who &apos;s really <unk> to me .
the child in me is really excited about such opportunities .
i talked a lot about magic .
i mean , i don &apos;t mean magicians and dragons , but the magic of childhood , the ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i found found quite exciting .
so here you have to blow the ipad and wash the fireflies .
and the way through the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that was fascinated as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single <unk> .
and so here &apos;s the one book , and every world is a little <unk> , which i &apos;m here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens a map .
<unk> have always been maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows and it folds and serves to orientation in the rest of the book .
it &apos;s also other places of the book .
i &apos;m going in .
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is <unk> , but also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve heard all of the <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were caught thousands of years in <unk> chambers , in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary story , for children .
a story that deals with new affairs , like the <unk> .
so , for the theme of <unk> , a big problem over the last 10 years is that kids are in their dorm rooms , with their computers , without the .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;ll be sent to a search . you have to go out and gather the camera of the three-dimensional objects .
as a child , i had collections of monks , stones , <unk> and shells .
and somehow the kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
this is <unk> . you have to go out to take a picture of a flower and tag a picture .
in another chapter , you have to give up a piece of <unk> <unk> and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that can then put online .
a kid in london shows the picture of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually took .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities to connect the world and technology to connect .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where you use the video of the ipads and and through augmented reality , a animation of calls that appear on a plant in front of the house .
on one place , the screen is with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , blow them away and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the natural of technology can come closer and in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and we closer to the natural world , and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons , or advertising issues .
i spend most of my time with the socially weakest in the <unk> and places where there are lots of hopelessness .
being here at ted , and to see how much it is , given me a lot of power .
and in the short time here , i was told , &quot; ted has a identity .
you can tell things that have influence around the world .
and sometimes , when something comes about ted , it gets meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we saw some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher , have meaning , but that &apos;s the words of a dedicated teacher in particular .
as a physician , you can do good . but you can do more than a doctor , but you can do more .
and that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity .
i did not learn that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i was big in a family , a traditional <unk> household , which was dominated by a <unk> , and this <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had a effect .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
it was also the starting of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia as a slave .
it was born around 1880 , and the experience of slavery is a very strong way .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a young boy , she came to me and she <unk> me .
they made me feel like i could barely breathe . then let me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came to me and she said , &quot; do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and when i said no , they &apos;d give me back . if i said , &quot; let me go , &quot; she made me in silence .
she was something that made you want to be near her .
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention .
my cousins were walking around everywhere .
i remember i had to be eight or nine , i woke up one morning and went into the living room , all my cousins walked around .
my grandmother was at the end of the bunk , staring at me .
i first thought that was a game .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
this was about 15 or 20 minutes . then she stood up and came over to me and she came up with me and said , &quot; come on , come on . you and me , we need to talk . &quot;
i remember remember it was yesterday .
i will never forget it .
and she took me out , and she said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; i said , &quot; aye . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want . &quot;
i will never forget that .
and she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; as first <unk> , you &apos;re always going to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise that you &apos;re going to take care of them . &quot;
i &apos;m my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , grandmother , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and she said , &quot; next time , &quot; next time , you &apos;ll always do the right thing , &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; well , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise is is you will never drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yeah , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up in the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who is a year older and a sister younger sister .
when i was 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home , and i brought this <unk> beer with a bow and i and went and went to the woods .
we just <unk> around like this as well .
then he took a beer and he offered a person &apos;s sister , and she assumed , and then she phoned me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . all right . i &apos;m just doing . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do that , and today we do , you &apos;re doing whatever we do .
i had what , your sister had . go , &quot; <unk> a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . just do . just do . &quot;
my brother looked at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? now , what . &quot;
and then he looked at me in the face and he said , &quot; oh no , no , you &apos;re not still crazy for the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother told all the grandchildren that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;ll tell you something .
i should not be doing that .
this is maybe <unk> to public public .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m <unk> , i &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s rude . i say that because identity means .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people about things that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all of her grandchildren , they &apos;re special special .
my grandfather was during the prison of prison in prison .
my uncle died of infectious diseases .
and she believed that these were the issues that we had to take care of .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different from 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in <unk> and in prison .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest incarceration agency in the world .
seven million people are on <unk> , or with <unk> <unk> .
in my opinion , <unk> has changed our world radically .
in social , and poor people , despair and hopelessness , they are <unk> despair of this change .
one of three male black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , in <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
in cities , in cities , from los angeles , from los angeles , baltimore -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black young men in prison , in prison , in jail , to stop , or with <unk> <unk> .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with <unk> , it &apos;s also being driven by poverty .
we have a <unk> in this country that they treated much better if they &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
wealth , not <unk> , affects the outcome .
but yet , we seem to be satisfied with it .
a policy policy and anger has us us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost touch touch .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of <unk> developments .
my home home <unk> <unk> them , <unk> , when they &apos;re convicted of the bribe .
here , in alabama , 34 percent of male male population have lost their <unk> .
we conjecture that in 10 years the average of the <unk> of the civic <unk> will be as high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i <unk> children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , <unk> children of death to death in jail .
in this country , there are children who are <unk> <unk> without <unk> .
we &apos;ve been running a lot of practice already .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we believe that because we &apos;ve taught us that the real question is , has a human being to die for a <unk> crime ?
that &apos;s a very profound question .
but you can think about how we see our identity .
the other perspective is not : did someone make a death for death , but : do we deserve to kill ?
i find that fascinating .
death penalty death is defined by error .
in nine people we &apos;ve executed , one that we have for innocent people who have been discharged from the <unk> and from death death .
an amazing <unk> . one of nine innocent .
i find that fascinating .
we would never let somebody fly with an airplane if for nine planes , the lasers , one <unk> .
but somehow we can do it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question , whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m <unk> my students , i &apos;m talking about slavery . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the end of the <unk> , to the beginning of the second war war .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for the african-american in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to fear fear .
or bombs from bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped your life .
these older people are coming to me and say , &quot; mr. , <unk> , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re talking to talk to you , you say , &quot; we should stop saying that we have to do with the first time in our nation &apos;s history , after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no , no -- tell the people we grew up with this . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> <unk> were <unk> and apartheid .
and yet in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what the meaning of the actions we have in the historical context .
we &apos;re always joining each other .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race race , and i think it &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> is not too transcending the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve given a few talks to germany on death penalty death .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply troubling to hear you like that . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , you can never give them more .
it was very quiet . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever kill ourselves for the systematic killing of people .
it would be <unk> of us , consciously and <unk> people .
i thought about it .
what it would feel like to live in a world where german state would make people <unk> , especially if they were <unk> , many jews were .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old <unk> , we humans are taking -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted of death death 11 times a half , when the <unk> is white , when the <unk> is black , the <unk> white , and the victim knows -- in the same states , where the earth is <unk> .
and yet , there &apos;s these mental modification .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with these , these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but eventually , this realities of suffering from suffering , abuse , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
i seem to be able to unite both .
because we &apos;re ultimately talking about needing more hope , more commitment , more commitment to fit in a complex world .
for me , it means to take and think about the poor , the <unk> , the who never will be at ted .
but thinking in a way that is integrated in our own lives .
we all have to believe in the end of things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re so rational , we &apos;re so much .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just coming from our minds .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> , which i think is us to not just open to be open for all the bright and <unk> things , but also for the dark and the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politician , once said .
when we were fighting the oppression , we wanted to do anything possible , but what we needed most was hope , was to be a intellectual inspired , to be sometimes in <unk> places , and witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the essence of what i think is the <unk> of the <unk> .
there &apos;s no way of technology and design that allows us to be completely human and not human , unless we don &apos;t have eyes and ears , for poverty , for the and the .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges a lot more of us than if we don &apos;t know what to do .
it &apos;s going to touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i was privileged to meet the great , pink parks .
woman was , again , back to <unk> , where she had two of her oldest friends , <unk> <unk> , who had organized the <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- and virginia <unk> -- a white , her husband , <unk> <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women met and they were just .
occasionally , he <unk> me and said , &quot; <unk> , ms. parks come to the city . we want to talk .
do you want to listen and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , i like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what will you do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just listened .
it was always so inspiring , so <unk> .
and i was sitting there thinking listened to these women , and after a few hours , woman turned to me and said , &quot; well , <unk> , tell me what that is to be the same thing .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to put injustice .
<unk> people want to help people who were innocent convicted .
we want to explore and extract discrimination in the <unk> .
we want to abolish <unk> <unk> without <unk> for children .
we want something to the death penalty .
we want to lower the number of prisoners .
we want to abolish <unk> . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and after that , she looked at me and she said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
and then woman <unk> himself , and he put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why you have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to get ways to get these challenges : these problems , this deficit , that suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i &apos;ve learned a few very simple things .
that we are all more than the worst thing we ever did .
i think that &apos;s true of every person on the planet .
if someone is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , it &apos;s not just a thief .
even who kills someone is not just a killer .
and because that &apos;s , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that needs to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think so .
i believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty is the opposite of poverty .
and finally , i think , although she &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so stimulating , we &apos;re not being measured at the end of our technology , not the things we develop , not about our intellect and minds .
and finally , a society will not measured how they treated their rich and powerful and powerful , but as they deal with the poor , the x-files , the <unk> .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us feel .
sometimes i get the balance . a story to the end .
sometimes i fall too much .
i &apos;m tired of tired of all of us .
and sometimes these ideas of ideas are ahead of the way that we think about it .
i <unk> these kids who were convicted of very difficult to be .
i go to the <unk> and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and that &apos;s supposed to be a <unk> .
so i question myself , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn somebody to turn somebody turn it into something he &apos;s not ?
the judge is him as adults , but i see a child .
i stayed up at a night , and i thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he must have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should wish that you would .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think more right , i started working on a service .
i had a <unk> , poor black boy as a client .
and i started with this . the headline was , &quot; hey , my poor , <unk> black , like a privileged , <unk> , white , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
in my school , i explained that error was the <unk> and the police and the police and the <unk> .
there was a crazy line that there &apos;s nothing more <unk> in this country , there &apos;s only more error .
the next morning i woke up and i didn &apos;t know if i was dreaming this crazy ethiopian ethiopian woman or even written him .
and i had not only written him , but i was sent to court .
a few months went to , and i had just forgotten everything .
but i decided , i &apos;m sorry , my god , i have to go into court and this crazy case .
i got into the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard to do so painful .
finally , i got out of my car , and i went up to the court .
when i was the staircase to the dish there was a elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; aye . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
then he took me to the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was force .
it touched something very deep in me , identity , the ability of every single person to contribute to a community , to a community of hope .
well , i went to the <unk> .
and once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you ask this crazy teacher ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more and more people came in because they were angry .
i &apos;d written these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office .
in the <unk> , the <unk> of people who were angry that we were talking about color color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my <unk> , i saw the janitors and go down .
he kept seeing the window over and over the window , and could hear the whole thing .
he went up and down .
finally , this older black man came in with a very <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and sat down behind me , almost on the <unk> .
10 minutes later the judge announced a pause .
during the pause , a <unk> was in , the <unk> was in the <unk> .
this <unk> ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m at the way to say this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal of the eyes . don &apos;t give up . &quot;
i came to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe far away , but it &apos;s the justice <unk> .
that we are not fully developed as humans , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and human rights .
that our survival of survival is connected to each individual .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , pity and justice .
and most of all , i want to leave you with those of you who are seeing this , just say , lose the goal out of your eyes . don &apos;t give up .
you have seen this audience , this community , that a teacher &apos;s obvious wish and to help them and do something .
what else can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in this spring , where it &apos;s about to actually do a effort , something from the <unk> <unk> , otherwise to the politics of punishment .
here , in california , for example , in the next five years , you will be a billion dollars for the death death rate one billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all the <unk> doesn &apos;t end with a <unk> .
56 percent of the <unk> don &apos;t come before court .
there &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this <unk> is suggest to invest the money in more <unk> and safety .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the past three decades , the <unk> is <unk> down in america .
and this is a lot of the <unk> that has been put into a relationship with increased <unk> .
what would you tell someone who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of <unk> hasn &apos;t changed very much .
most of the world &apos;s most <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really exist in the class of <unk> .
it was the <unk> <unk> against drugs .
so the dramatic numbers come from the prisoners .
we have <unk> from the rhetoric of the punishment .
so we have <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> , that people can put over behind bars , for a <unk> , for the theft of good , rather than that , that they force them to kill the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who have victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i think our current <unk> doesn &apos;t help us .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , they really have a string of string cord here .
they &apos;re a inspiring personality .
thank you for being at ted . thank you .
bin laden brings a heightened <unk> .
famine in somalia : <unk> of the police .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> . dangerous <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . the number of times : 65 dead .
speaker 8 : <unk> . speaker 9 : <unk>
different speakers : <unk> . mass mass . tornado .
recession . gridlock . <unk> . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a couple of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
in fact , media media prefer to show us negative issues , because our minds are really giving attention to this .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
every second , our senses will start to focus much more information on our brain every second .
and because we don &apos;t care about our survival , the first legal for all the information is part of our <unk> , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our main system , our <unk> system .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> all of the information on the search for any kind of danger of danger in our environment .
so if we look at the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; when it comes out , the demand goes , &quot; is very true .
now , with all our digital devices , that <unk> us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , all this negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everyone thinks it &apos;s always worse .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
perhaps the tremendous progress that we &apos;ve done in the past century is by a series of forces , so strong that it will be possible for us in the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate , <unk> , water and water -- we &apos;ve already .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at putting problems in a very long time , but ultimately eventually to overcome .
so let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can be able to eradicate development .
over the last hundred years , the average lifespan has doubled more than doubled , which is the inflation of the world &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
child mortality has a tenth of a barrel .
and that &apos;s that the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and communication costs are reduced to a <unk> .
steve pinker showed us that we are now in a very peaceful time of the <unk> .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> has gone from 25 percent in the last 130 years of the last 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
in fact , we have redefined poverty .
think that a large percentage of americans who live under poverty poverty , access to power , water , toilets , refrigerators , televisions , mobile , mobile , and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the <unk> of the earth , could never have been <unk> of such a <unk> .
the basis of a lot of it is creating technologies , and these are growing <unk> .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that becomes information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the <unk> will double 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less and less than a million times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
notice two things at this curve .
first , how do you get it -- in good times , in good times , war or peace , depression and depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers building computers .
it &apos;s not going to be for none of our big problems .
also , despite their logarithmic <unk> on the left , it &apos;s upward up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everyone .
<unk> , what my friends call on autodesk , is the sensors and networks , robots , robots , that allow the personal production of our planet to synthetic biology , <unk> , vaccination and food , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> <unk> at risk ?
that was a big thing .
i tried to look at newspapers and pay for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson <unk> human enemies . &quot;
risk is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the illusion of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence of any owner &apos;s brain is available .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i at ted , i started a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students to all these technologies , with focused focus on how these can be used to solve the big challenges of humanity .
and every year , we ask the students to create products and products and services within a decade , can be positive life of billions of people .
think about that a group of students today can influence the life of billions of people .
thirty years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
today we can have done to dozens of companies that have done this .
if i think about making abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on the planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of opportunities .
it &apos;s about creating abundance from a <unk> .
because , the purpose is <unk> , and technology is a resource of <unk> force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of <unk> to dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> himself got <unk> .
the king of <unk> , though , got <unk> .
aluminum was at that time the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and <unk> .
this is why the dome of the <unk> was made of aluminum .
even though aluminum <unk> takes up percent of the <unk> , it &apos;s not as pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology of <unk> was developed , and it made <unk> so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
let &apos;s take this analogy into the future .
we think of <unk> today .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re living on a planet with <unk> more energy than we &apos;re using a year .
16 <unk> energy <unk> all the 88 minutes to the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not the matter of scarcity , the problem is perfect .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve been able to reduce the cost of solar in india to 50 percent of the price of consumption -- <unk> rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year .
last month , published with a study that shows that up to the end of the decade , the <unk> areas of the united states , in average , of the average of the average , is average cents per gallon .
and if we have a <unk> , then we &apos;ll have water in the abundance .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
do you remember when carl sagan the <unk> ticket in 1990 when it was saturn saturn , went back toward earth ?
he took a famous picture . how did it say ?
&quot; a <unk> blue . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> .
we live on a planet that is covered to 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent saltwater , two percent is <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting by 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there are hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation today with dean ornish , one of the innovators of the clinton , i want to share with you -- he gave me the permission -- his <unk> , the <unk> , &quot; and many of you may have heard , it &apos;s the size of a <unk> in the <unk> .
it can produce a thousand gallons of clean drinking water per day -- water water , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents per gallon .
the the the of coca-cola has just <unk> a big <unk> rat in developing countries .
and when everything is fine , and i &apos;m very confident , coca-cola will apply globally to global countries globally in the world .
this is <unk> innovation that &apos;s today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones also .
you mean , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent <unk> of mobile phones from mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
just think that a <unk> with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better <unk> than president reagan was 25 years ago .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the abundance , as no one would ever have predicted .
and it &apos;s better , the things you and i spend several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photo , libraries of books and music , <unk> of technology -- now literally <unk> and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best part of that is maybe what we expected in the health .
last month , i had the pleasure , with the <unk> , called $ 10 million <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;re giving teams around the world to connect all these technologies together in a cell phone , so that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s with ai , you can <unk> or test your <unk> .
and to win , the device needs to be a better diagnosis than a team of physicians .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the sales and 1.3 percent of the health care .
if this device sequenced a <unk> or a <unk> , who is not known , it calls the <unk> and prevents a pandemic from the eruption .
but now to the biggest force that is going to lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines represent population .
we just crossed the <unk> .
and by the way , the biggest environmental contributor against an explosion is a better education and diet in the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
by 2020 , we &apos;re going to grow two from two to five billion <unk> .
and three billion new heads , which we &apos;ve never heard before , will be the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what are they going to want ?
and instead of making of of of of , i see one of the largest economic <unk> of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by using the healthier , and they &apos;re better trained by the <unk> , and by being the ability to use 3d printers and &quot; <unk> computing , &quot; and more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion grow , healthy , educated , productive members of the <unk> ?
how about a sentence of new , never voices .
how about the oppressed , wherever you are to give a voice to pay attention to the , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people bring ?
how about <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned from the x prize is that little teams that are motivated by passion and focus , things that can create large companies and governments only in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might know .
it &apos;s a game that is called tamper .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to evolve .
according to his behavior , we can predict the structure and function function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was played by university professors and so on .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it showed that today , the human pattern of the brain is better than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best <unk> in the world , this was not a <unk> , nor a <unk> , a doctor , who was a assistant in the day as a assistant at the day , and at night , the best <unk> in the world was .
ladies and gentlemen , what &apos;s great to me in our future is the fact that we have more power today than individuals to provide us the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to the exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online to do the new challenges , and to do what needed to do .
we expect to expect for couple of extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something about a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it &apos;s starting to be a medical medical , and i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;ve been a long enough in business , and i can allow myself to give a piece of my own fake <unk> to allow you to do this .
but before i get to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re close to the <unk> and moving us into the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
<unk> is soon and and turns out statistics and to make these benefits to a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to challenge you to a statistics that i hope most of you have heard about .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 if a bat is 300 .
that means that the player is safely beating by 10 .
that means beat the ball into the <unk> , he &apos;s up , he &apos;s not going to get caught , and he tries to flip the ball to the first base , and it was not done in time , and it was in safety .
three 10 from 10 .
do you know how to call a <unk> in <unk> baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
you know how to call a <unk> ?
that &apos;s safe to be in the rest of 10 .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> baseball player met by a <unk> season over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less comfortable with i talked to you about .
imagine you have a <unk> , and you &apos;ll get a <unk> , whose <unk> 400 is a <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine you &apos;re living in a remote remote area , and you have a loved man with <unk> <unk> and your <unk> <unk> that to a <unk> whose <unk> at 200 lies .
but you know what ?
it &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s on the <unk> branch .
and she &apos;s a <unk> .
it somehow doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think like the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk> , should be a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in the medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor or a doctor should be .
what we do is , we &apos;re each one of them , including locked into the world with the claim perfectly perfect .
never make a mistake , no one makes any idea about the details of how this is supposed to be done .
and this is the message i took in the medical court .
i was a compulsively <unk> student .
in high school , a <unk> said that brian <unk> would learn for a <unk> .
and it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the nurses in general hospital in general general hospital , <unk> from here .
i learned everything .
in my <unk> , i learned the origins and display every single branch of tissue , every branch of one artery , which is from the ascending <unk> , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> to classify <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i was more and more knowledge all the time .
and i was good , i was doing with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the principal with the impression that i knew , if i knew everything , and everything , or at least as much as possible , as close to <unk> as possible that i was immune immunity to do that .
and it worked for a time until i met wife printer .
i was in a <unk> here in toronto as a woman , to the <unk> of the hospital .
at that point i was the <unk> <unk> of the service service .
and it was my assignment when the <unk> <unk> advice was to investigate the <unk> .
and give to my <unk> .
i studied the wife printer , and she was in <unk> .
and when i was listening to her , she made <unk> sounds .
and when i was eating her chest with the <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides , told me that she suffered under <unk> heart failure .
this is a state that the heart is failing , instead of pumping the entire blood on the lung , and a part of the blood flow in the lung , and it <unk> it , and so the <unk> came .
and it wasn &apos;t a hard thing to do .
i hired them and made me care .
i gave her a <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine to give up the <unk> , which is that you would throw the liquid off .
and over a period of a and a half , they started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i did my first mistake ; i sent her home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take the receiver up , and i was supposed to have what i should have had a call at my <unk> to make it a chance to have a chance to have a chance to make a picture .
and he knew he would have been able to put additional information into her .
maybe i did it for good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take the responsibility that i was so , and so i would be able to deal with my patients without having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
and by sent you home , i would send a quiet voice to me , i was going to give me a little voice , i i , &quot; goldman , not a good idea . do not do that . &quot;
and i really did not know , much of the time that i asked the nurse , which was about woman &apos;s printer , &quot; do you believe it &apos;s okay when she goes home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and said in <unk> , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;ll go well . &quot;
i remember it as being yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and a ambulance and a <unk> and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working on .
and at the end of the day i packed my things , wham the hospital and went to parking parking parking to ride home with the car when i did something i didn &apos;t do .
i went home from the <unk> on my journey .
and there said another nurse , not the sister who saw the last day , but another three words , and these three words are most of the most <unk> i know .
other medical practices are also being this same , but the default idea is particularly especially because we see patients only as fleeting .
the three words are : remember ?
&quot; remember the patients they were doing at home ? &quot;
the nurse was <unk> .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about an hour after she got home , after i sent her home , she collapsed and the family called 911 . and the <unk> brought her back to the <unk> with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous <unk> .
she hardly rolls and was blue .
the <unk> <unk> all <unk> .
they gave her a <unk> .
she was clinging to the <unk> .
i was shocked and <unk> to the inner <unk> .
and i would get this rollercoaster , because she came to the intensive school after the school and hoping she would recover .
and after two , three days , it realized that she would never be awakening .
she had not suffered a <unk> <unk> .
their family was adopting .
and over the course of eight eight or nine days , they &apos;re going to be a <unk> .
on the <unk> day , they <unk> them -- -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
they say that you never forget the names of the names of the people .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the next weeks i took a and i learned the first time to be the absence of <unk> shame that in our medical culture -- felt myself alone , isolated , not the kind of psychic shame you &apos;re because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you know all of the healthy shame , if you give a secret to the best friend &apos;s , even though that one on <unk> and you get caught up with the best friend , and i &apos;m going to get a terrible discussion , but when you end up doing the bad sense , you never do that kind of mistake .
if you do <unk> and make the mistake never do .
that &apos;s the kind of <unk> shame .
the junk species i &apos;m talking about is the one in the <unk> .
it &apos;s the one who tells you that not what you do is not you &apos;re bad .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t on my <unk> , because he was very dear .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was holding the <unk> and he sure that i wouldn &apos;t be sued .
but i asked myself these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why do i <unk> them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i have gone to medicine ?
but slowly it &apos;s just a .
i started feeling better .
and then a day of day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke broke , and i might tell myself , again , i can feel better again .
and i was out to me that if i &apos;ve been my efforts to get to perfection and never make a mistake , that the voice could be <unk> .
and she did .
and i was working on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had taken service in the <unk> hospital in a <unk> hospital north toronto , and i was <unk> a 25 year-old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of go , and i got in a hurry .
he always showed up there .
i looked in the <unk> , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him to .
and even when he went out of the door , he showed him his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> , and my <unk> asked me to go to her office .
and she said three words : do you remember ?
&quot; remember the patient with the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
it turned out that he was a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can google this , but it &apos;s not a commodity infection , but it &apos;s the top <unk> , and causes the <unk> of the <unk> .
and luckily , he didn &apos;t die .
he got <unk> <unk> and recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , felt me liberated and went to work work to work again and again .
i have a <unk> in a <unk> , two times a <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of it , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that only only 14 patients a night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no imperfections in their treatment .
one was a thought i had <unk> .
i <unk> the x-ray of the kidneys . when it was without <unk> , my colleague at the <unk> of the patient &apos;s <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> in the lower right sector called the <unk> .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> to <unk> him and i also asked my colleagues to be .
and he did , and as he was a <unk> in the right sector , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> and they were fine .
both of them are <unk> me , <unk> me .
and i would happy to tell you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years , which many of my colleagues were saying , but complete nonsense .
some of my favorite stories happened in the last five years .
it &apos;s alone , <unk> and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t finish my mistakes and talk about them , if i &apos;m the quiet voice that tells me what really happened to me , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach my mistakes so that they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i was in a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time of somebody who &apos;s talking about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh yes , you go to a cocktail party party , and you may like to hear about any other doctor , but you don &apos;t hear somebody hear about your mistakes .
if i was to go into a room full of colleagues and ask them to their immediate support and tell them what i just told you , i would not reach the end of the second story before they really would get to a joke , anyone would have a joke , they would change the topic and forget the rest .
and in fact , if i knew my colleagues that a <unk> in my hospital had <unk> on the wrong leg , then they trust me , i would have trouble looking at him in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system we live in .
it &apos;s a totally <unk> of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who do not do , those who are <unk> , the <unk> , and those who are <unk> with bad results and good outcomes .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response to antibodies that attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that when we make those who make mistakes from medicine , that we have a safe system .
but there are two problems in this .
in my about 20 years of medical medical and journalism , i made a personal medical study on medical mistakes and wrong treatments around me for one of my first article that i was star star star star , and i wrote the &quot; white <unk> , black species . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we work in a system where we have mistakes every day , where one of 10 <unk> either is either a false or wrong , , in the <unk> , , and <unk> and <unk> and dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians are dying of <unk> brook .
in the united states , the institute of medicine is the number of 100,000 .
both are strong <unk> because we don &apos;t look at the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a <unk> where the medical system , the medical care system has doubling all two to three years , we cannot keep up .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error so that we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with chest chest .
then i take the same patient with <unk> , making it <unk> and <unk> and and i &apos;ll just a slightly more comfortable breath , and suddenly the story is <unk> with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same time .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of this is inevitable .
so , if you take the system , as i &apos;ve been taught , and all the <unk> <unk> , then at the end , no one left .
and you know the <unk> about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , white <unk> , black type , &quot; i &apos;m my worst mistake , &quot; &quot; is my worst mistake , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; my worst mistakes , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; and then i show him the microphone .
and then your pupils are , they &apos;re <unk> , they look down and they &apos;re hard to get down and start to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i &apos;m going to go . &quot;
what they need is a environment that they &apos;re able to attach to .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new african physician is a human , white , and it &apos;s not proud of making his humanity , but it &apos;s not proud of making anything to you , so that it can be passed away .
it divides their experiences with others .
it supports when others are talking about their mistakes .
and she &apos;s other other mistakes , not to <unk> , but in a criminal , supportive way of all benefit from it .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and when that &apos;s , people are mistakes from time to time .
so that the system develops into creating <unk> , which makes easier make the mistakes that people make , and it makes so much to create the <unk> of , and actually <unk> the <unk> of the public , and actually rewarded the potential , and even for people like me who make mistakes and the <unk> of those things .
my name is brian <unk> .
i &apos;m the new olympic doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
but i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn to learn from it to others .
i don &apos;t know what you hold me , but i can live .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories before the time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was here .
you may think he &apos;s <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
he actually collected fish .
he described one of them as very &quot; usual . &quot;
it was a <unk> .
in the &apos; 80s , he was in in great style .
now , he &apos;s on the red list of the species .
this story is we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos or the other , which is not very special .
yet , we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the <unk> still described them as untouched .
what happened here ?
the second story is to be another concept , the <unk> <unk> .
because i experienced it when i was studying a lagoon in <unk> .
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate .
and i got a bad job , and i was convinced that i really wasn &apos;t going from there .
it was my first <unk> .
and you can see , the lagoon was <unk> and a few mangroves .
there were <unk> of about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishermen lived well and <unk> in ghana .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish was shrunk to half of its size .
five , it &apos;s five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the fortune to be there .
so it hasn &apos;t changed , and yet everything changed .
my third little story tells me about my <unk> at the introduction of <unk> in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s , in the early &apos; 60s -- <unk> europe is many <unk> .
<unk> meant countries that started to grow 100 fish , the industrial fishing of this pretty ugly ship called <unk> 4 .
i drove on with it , and we did a lot of <unk> in the southern sea , and particularly in the <unk> .
we had no words for what we started there .
now i know that was the bottom of the ocean .
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the cause .
the most big part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , the <unk> , were <unk> .
essentially the bottom of the sea was on deck and then <unk> .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you get a survey and starts to get the commercial fishing .
the reason is changed . it &apos;s -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals is <unk> .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat , they threw them away because they were dead .
once again , we started a living .
she wasn &apos;t <unk> yet .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of hydrocarbons is going to encode each other by fishermen , when they &apos;re driving in areas where they &apos;re never been in .
it &apos;s not going to be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we &apos;re facing our <unk> to the new level , and we don &apos;t call ourselves what was there .
when you get it , it happens .
so on the y-axis , there are a good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the greens of your country , the <unk> .
time it changes . it changes because for people , they are their actions .
every generation looks at the images that you &apos;re starting to take in the beginning of your conscious life , as a standard and will all derive everything from it .
the difference is then perceived as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can be a sequence of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the <unk> remains .
and that &apos;s what our goal is now .
we want to get things that are gone or things that are no longer as they were .
you could now think that the problem was people who certainly , that they lived in <unk> societies , killed animals and who were only after a few generations , what they had done .
because obviously , an animal that was very often , before it was <unk> .
so you don &apos;t lose any common animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not going to be a big loss .
and over time , we focus on the large animals and the sea , that &apos;s the big fish .
they &apos;re going to be rare because we start them .
and over time , little fish left left , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is why people accept that .
well , because they don &apos;t know that was different .
of course , many people , scientists , tell that it was really different .
they will confirm it , because the evidence of how they compose in a earlier form of art , are not as they would like to be the evidence .
there &apos;s an election that the event that the report of a <unk> project that has been seen in this area , great <unk> , cannot be used , or by <unk> , because it &apos;s not scientific scientific .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in a <unk> societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
it shows the enormous amount of a huge amount of time playing a marine reserve .
because by inference , we &apos;re basically the past .
we &apos;re going to make the past that people can &apos;t understand because the <unk> changes changed and very low .
so the people who see a marine reserve and benefit from the view that it allows to break their their <unk> .
what about the people that can &apos;t do that , because they don &apos;t have access to -- people in the midwest for example ?
here can see , i think , art and film may be the gap , and simulations .
this is the simulation of the chesapeake bay .
there was a time ago , there was 500 years ago -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> may may remind you about &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were touched by this -- except from the <unk> , why were they so touched by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s something that has been lost in a way .
so my favorite one , the only one i &apos;m going to do is to <unk> to cameron , so he &apos;s <unk> water .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist <unk> , , if you had a typewriter , you had to get that in government .
they also had to take a sheet of paper out of this typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could pass back , where a text came from .
they found a paper with <unk> <unk> , they could seek the creator of these thought .
and we in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody would do something like this , and how much that would be the .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like that .
but if you &apos;re going to buy a new <unk> from the leading <unk> , and print one page , it &apos;s got bright yellow <unk> on every side , in a pattern that clearly makes the page clear to you and <unk> her printer .
this is happening today .
and nobody seems to be <unk> about that .
and this was an example of what our own governments are doing to us , the citizens , the citizens .
and this is one of the three <unk> of the existing <unk> today .
let &apos;s see what really happened in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three main <unk> .
there are <unk> .
for example , here , this is mr. <unk> &apos;s from <unk> in ukraine .
and the motives of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to earn a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several well-known cases of <unk> , <unk> , who have given their money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
these are matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so on .
these guys came online , but they &apos;ve been doing it illegal by using money from our <unk> , making money from our <unk> , or <unk> , who are doing our <unk> , or <unk> , who have collected our <unk> on the <unk> as we shop over a infected computer online .
the u.s. intelligence agency was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of mr. sam jain here , and in this program , <unk> million dollars , when it was frozen .
gentleman jain himself is on his feet , which is <unk> .
and i &apos;m saying it &apos;s more likely today that we are going to become victims of a <unk> than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will only be even worse .
the future is going to be playing online .
the second largest <unk> that we can see today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , or something , or through their audience .
groups like anonymous have been over the last 12 months , and they have become one of the most competitive on the field of the <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals , which are doing it for money , <unk> like anonymous , who are resistance , but the last group are nations , governments who lead the attacks .
there are a lot of us that are coming from <unk> .
it shows what &apos;s happening when governments are attacking their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> from the netherlands -- or it was .
in the last fall , it had to be <unk> because <unk> had been hacked .
somebody was <unk> , and had had the system system hacked .
and last week in a meeting with dutch <unk> , i hired one of the senior people to ask whether he had it possible for possible that because of the <unk> people .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die in a of such a hacks ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a certificate , you know , when you &apos;re a website with <unk> , with <unk> , for example , you &apos;re making it .
now we all use , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly common in <unk> states like iran , where they know that they can trust more than local <unk> , and they &apos;re about <unk> , so that local government cannot be <unk> in their conversation .
but can you if you yourself in a foreign foreign
<unk> hack and counterfeit <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the case of <unk> .
how about the arab spring and things that happened in egypt for example ?
now in egypt , the battle in april was the headquarters headquarters in april <unk> , and they found a lot of records .
and this records was a folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , notes of a in germany , company organized resident company sold a few programs that they -- in very large scale -- could intercept any communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for <unk> euro to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so western governments are providing <unk> governments to <unk> , so that they can do their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , a few weeks ago , the so-called <unk> <unk> , which was a <unk> <unk> , which was used by german <unk> to <unk> her own citizens .
if you &apos;re <unk> in a <unk> , , you &apos;ll be able to get your phone off .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap their connection .
they use tools like the <unk> to make their computer with a <unk> , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> , to collect their <unk> .
so if we think about things like this , the obvious answer of people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t apply to me because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not about debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we &apos;re today , in 2011 , our governments like trust , we &apos;re all right that we &apos;re going to give up forever .
and trust we trust , we trust ourselves every single government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to do with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were made , and <unk> made a simple idea : blood expectancies of cement with <unk> <unk> that fit .
they were very quickly the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they were us to build things that were bigger than us , buildings , bridges , stone , a stone after another .
essentially , the <unk> was the building block of our time .
almost hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out .
it was called the &quot; automatically <unk> stone . &quot;
and within a few years , lego moved into every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on the planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful bridges or beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for everybody .
lego basically has the <unk> , the building building in the world , taken a building block for our imagination .
in the meanwhile , in the same year , the bell labs , the next revolution , announced the next block .
the transistor was a small <unk> , which was a <unk> , <unk> building building to a world where everything interactive was interactive .
as the <unk> , the transistor allows us to build much larger , more sophisticated scales , a stone after another .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was only for experts .
personally , i personally accept that the building of our time for experts is reserved , and therefore i decided to change it .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic blood vessels that have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , tone , engines and sensor .
and the best part about it is that they connect with magnets .
they can &apos;t put them around in the way .
the stones are <unk> .
green is a , blue is power , pink is input , orange is wires .
so all they need to do is connect a blue and a green green , and they can build very quickly .
they extract a blue to a green green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and so you &apos;ve made a little <unk> .
take the switch out for a <unk> , which is , , , and you &apos;ve made a little <unk> .
add it to a extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a <unk> .
i &apos;ll stop that .
so the simple play is actually , really , really powerful .
instead of coding , you need to program , or <unk> , , you can program them with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to slow the light up or slow down , just turn on this button , and it makes the impulse faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in this world into a <unk> stone .
lights , notes , sound , engines , engines -- everything should be available .
we spread <unk> on children and see them playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , as you start to understand the electronics they &apos;re in the everyday world and they don &apos;t learn in school .
like a <unk> , , or why the doors are <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> .
we also brought <unk> to <unk> .
so for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with <unk> as a material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water water , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago , we brought <unk> to risd , and we gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just cardboard , wood and paper -- and said , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> of play-dough that &apos;s afraid of the darkness .
for this <unk> , , <unk> was another material , electronics was just one material .
and we want to do this stuff for everyone .
so , open-source open source .
you can go to the website , all the <unk> and make them yourself .
we want the world of creators , the inventor , who encourage <unk> , because this world we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , go out and start invent .
thank you .
