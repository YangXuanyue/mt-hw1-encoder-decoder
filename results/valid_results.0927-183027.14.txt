now , why does this matter for human health ?
here &apos;s a graph of the <unk> of dolphins in the bay bay .
and i remember sitting on my desk , and i thought , &quot; now i know it . what a great scientific discovery , &quot; but it was so terrible .
they &apos;re always closed up the world and more and more and more and more and more , and i think we should have <unk> .
initially , i showed you how powerful we have the ecosystem of monterey bay , pollution and the <unk> and all the other problems .
<unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> .
about the same time , his mother asked him , &quot; do you know the book of michael <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; ?
we were really afraid .
craig here moving the head .
you saw the skeleton .
we also have this ability .
it &apos;s because of modern way of something that is defined to the benefits of the benefits , but i think we should recognize , to what price .
clay shirky , this great redefinition of all mesh , has the assumption that here on the <unk> , in such wonderful way .
now , there are so many new foundations that are conducive to investment and investment , people together together , together in a more , in a bigger context .
and i &apos;m hopeful , because not only the philanthropy is reinventing , other large parts of social media and in the collective action business , <unk> business is <unk> .
i forbid this picture close to me . it &apos;s in my office , because i always have a mystic connection to these two men , i &apos;ve never met any of them .
my own research to mobile phones and <unk> shows that 80 percent of all calls calls in four people . 80 percent .
whenever they have a moment , they get close .
and with modern bureaucracy , a very <unk> approach evolved where there was a clear disconnect between the private environment and the public environment .
we &apos;re worried that <unk> , sms , facebook of the <unk> intimacy , but <unk> research research shows how the <unk> can make deeper relationships to <unk> love of the <unk> like remoteness and <unk> .
one of the things we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehicles -- is , as we believe , the first autonomous computer system in the world .
for example , the most powerful brain tends to generate a lot of <unk> .
no challenging task .
now , there &apos;s about $ 60,000 a year to get a people into jail .
her family has been living in a city called <unk> , west virginia .

and he sometimes won , you know , on a <unk> in los angeles -- a reason to love l.a. -- in the 1940s .
i started my company to help communities throughout the country to help their useful potential to improve the entire quality of their people .
and before you have kids , you won &apos;t understand what i mean . &quot;
these deaf people eventually discover at some point in adulthood , &quot; community .
it always takes time .
true blame is only from one person &apos;s party , and someone with down syndrome is not a person . &quot;
the more effective thing is that people are not far more .
but i found out that i was the kids i was born , so love that i don &apos;t want to imagine a life without it .
he wouldn &apos;t get out his legs .
i come from a privileged family . i &apos;ve been very lucky .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . and there you are .
this is the beginning of 2000 . my son , dimitri -- who &apos;s here today , many of you know dimitri -- went to cambodia and built built from us built school , just when she was linked with internet .
remember , because there are other people like bill gates , who said , &quot; man , you &apos;ve got real computers . &quot;
latin africa is quite rare . let &apos;s look at some languages .
and guess what ? we won it .
we have a tendency to really not integrate any extra <unk> to keep prices in the bottom .
for a <unk> , my apartment is kind of like the <unk> .
and we can take care of the issues of <unk> .
speaking from a fiscal cliff , i was told to be too <unk> , even though i don &apos;t know what party supports or attacks that .
wealth is going to be people who are not supposed to call <unk> .
the issue is , there &apos;s bigger disagreement here .
none of those most theories was a full success .
we fear that the world is moving .
and as a lot of work , we found something , or i found something that was really fascinated me , maybe you can remember .
in fact , there &apos;s just -- from light to darkness in six seconds .
i look at your faces very carefully .
this is not a expression of happiness .
this lady here actually has a particularly <unk> face , and both sides of these are beautiful .
this thing here , there &apos;s a light of light on it , if you move , so it gets a <unk> object , even though it &apos;s still silent -- just by making brilliant things that are made by the reflection .
i had to move this part , but only by a millimeter .
and one of the things i showed you before was a very complex .
it wins or loses in that moment .
the emotional band between this object and to them is a <unk> <unk> that happens before you even think about it .
i don &apos;t think we need to make that choice .
it &apos;s also a thought we &apos;ve forgotten .
i think it &apos;s necessary for me to return to the tradition of the sermon .
we don &apos;t think that way .
and at the end of the concert , they &apos;re all up and say , &quot; thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you . &quot;
the other thing is that art shouldn &apos;t explain that artists should not reveal their <unk> , because when they <unk> them , that destroyed the magic , and we might just just it .
art would be one of the tools that we can improve our society .
we may not agree with what religions are going to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way that they do .
absolutely . i meet how many of you , people saying , &quot; isn &apos;t there something bigger than we all , something else ? &quot;
because you &apos;re 90 percent agree , because you have similar vision on so many things , and you &apos;re polite about the point of view .
so he led me from places like chile -- the <unk> desert in chile -- to siberia , in in mines , in the japanese alps , in north america , to antarctica , to the south pole .
it &apos;s the largest lake in the world . it &apos;s 800 miles long .
and they won &apos;t believe it , but that &apos;s what the <unk> big telescope will be called .
this hut was built by robert <unk> scott and his men when they came to antarctica , on their first expedition to the south pole .
remember , all this underground <unk> people in extreme cold , in <unk> temperatures .
this is an interesting statement , i &apos;ll end up on this .
what people do first is that they can look for the book , which you can look for in the book , and that &apos;s fun .
there were quite a lot of people .
but how do we all scan them ?
we &apos;ve reached the 10 cents a page if we work with big volume .
i &apos;m not sure what exactly means .
and a day , they &apos;re about two or three <unk> .
with about 15 dollars an hour and about 100 to 150 dollars an hour , we can put material very <unk> online and have it on the net .
the question is : is this the world we want to live in ?
flowers are <unk> to .
we all know the world has problems .
they &apos;re <unk> by spores , they <unk> them .
when you go through the landscape , it <unk> up into your shoes and tries to respond to the <unk> .
across all the <unk> .
some of these mushrooms are very happy .
this is an extraordinarily rare <unk> .
i did something that nobody would have made .
the box of life -- they get a dvd from the ted conference -- they &apos;re giving earth and water , and they have both <unk> and <unk> fungi , like spores , as the agarikon mushrooms .
i &apos;ve also lived in biosphere 2 .
we wanted to know , is life enough enough ?
i kind of eaten myself in some way .
and the doctor studied us to make sure that we were actually really good .
and everybody went to me .
<unk> , a part of ethiopia used to be one of these places that are amazing and incredibly <unk> , and i have no idea how people are going to live there .
this , this beautiful picture , this is the amazon .
this is actually a <unk> .
i had to think about how to take <unk> and cut , but also how you choose the right person to come into a <unk> .
you put the tail , you get blood , you throw the blood , you looked at it under the microscope , you put the culture , you injected the <unk> .
but we need a <unk> , <unk> for patients .
and that &apos;s how medicine feels sometimes .
we looked at <unk> for skyscrapers , we looked at the <unk> , and we found that they had education and education , and then they have something : they have checklists .
and it &apos;s just very difficult .
so these are really , really , bees , and that &apos;s very important .
so that means that beekeepers can replace their dead peoples very well , and they could keep the losses low .
they take their hives and they their families up to twice a year .
honeybees are in the minority .
let &apos;s take a cave in new york with an 15,000 bats , now it &apos;s 1,000 . this is 1,000 , it &apos;s like san francisco is in the <unk> of the half of the planet .
now , not all of us are <unk> , or lawns that we can turn , and , of course , you can always get a meadow in a plant of a plant .
and i was also wearing at the holy night in my wife &apos;s family .
and to defend my title -- like <unk> and other athletes do that -- i thought i &apos;d do this again , and i won again .
that &apos;s very promising .
why ?
the blue , the largest living organism on our planet . that &apos;s wrong , completely wrong .
during night , they took their leaves and they reduce the movement , and during the day the leaves will open -- there &apos;s a lot more movement .
he wrote a very interesting letter to one of his friends , <unk> <unk> , at the time the president of the royal society , the largest scientific authority in britain in which he spoke about a <unk> .

now , children who are not <unk> yet are a special case .
they &apos;re a kind of <unk> .

so that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done on this <unk> .
the ant is not alone .
you &apos;ve just heard this guy .
i really appreciate that .
well , i don &apos;t think so .
well maybe we should take it metaphorically .
it &apos;s the devil of speaking . &quot;
so they &apos;re actually a chord , and each one of you is a very aggressive chord .
men , if you don &apos;t understand anything from this talk , it &apos;s trying to listen with <unk> listening , and you can change your relationships .

i &apos;m here to commit them to change the way people and other creatures are things .
not through the <unk> , but enabled by collective action that comes from from the .
the other great narrative of social media is the tragedy of the <unk> .
so , instead of having his <unk> lists , they &apos;re treating them like a network and trains them to produce better , even though they also train them to produce better for their competition .

do you think the african union is going to organize such a conference ?
there are some things you need to know .
the speaker who was on the stage here was <unk> muhammad , <unk> <unk> that we had <unk> leaders in africa .
by stealing it from your <unk> people .
traditionally hate africans -- they hate the military .
they decide what they do .
he &apos;s not getting a help from government , and he &apos;s building a second , <unk> boat .
one of the things that would all connect us together .
scott &apos;s results were full of it .
and the challenge for algorithmic filter , these personalized filters , is that they pass this balance , because they &apos;re going on , first of all , what you first click on .
it &apos;s supposed to be <unk> to new ideas and to new people and foreign perspectives .
and the man replied , &quot; very beautiful , what ? &quot;
now , i know you &apos;re waiting for more bad modes -- i &apos;m just fun -- but now i &apos;m just going to take a quick repetition , and then i &apos;ll show you new material about possible solutions .
in may be a update in may be a update on version , where you can go to the purchase of <unk> <unk> .
now , i think of all the republicans here : it shouldn &apos;t go around <unk> .
what excites me about the gulf of the gulf is really impressed to the fact that they are <unk> <unk> .
and there &apos;s no one trying to do that , except a few people who are trying to keep the beach still .
we have charles that bacteria eat oil ?
this <unk> hit the ocean .
when the japanese harbor <unk> , at least they were <unk> .
in terms of the <unk> of birds , i don &apos;t want to make a <unk> <unk> about people sending birds .
okay , people who call themselves conservative , if they really wanted to be really conservative and really really <unk> , they should send these <unk> to the <unk> .
it &apos;s about right and wrong .
and i developed a system to produce medical isotopes .
all right , &quot; i &apos;m more than my genes , &quot; all together .
i didn &apos;t ask you to <unk> because it &apos;s true , but to remember it .
they contain a molecule that we know as a protein .
and this is just a <unk> . it &apos;s a lot smaller than a human being .
now , neurons , like trees , can grow new branches , lose old ones .
and we can even talk about the <unk> .
if you look at that number , you can easily find that there &apos;s a big potential for <unk> in the brain .
perhaps this technology will be able to <unk> ourselves through both and <unk> our own brains .
he &apos;s working on music videos and games with his company , the <unk> <unk> .
so here we &apos;ve prepared a quick experiment to show you this .
ks : no , not .
while he did that , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : so , how it works : there &apos;s a matrix of <unk> .
ridiculous , right ?
and a few months ago , a friend sent me a link to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge scandal for a couple of weeks .
but he still did that .
so his farm is incredible .
then he found this wild plant , which is the <unk> .
and then they fly in the circle .
i finally got to try to try it before i left .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what the hell is that ?
at least , i think thinking .
farmers emerge from nature to find solutions to find answers , rather than nature solutions to nature .
and to change the old fire , to change two great stories about oil and electricity that both give two fifth of the fossil energy to the air .
our fuel for mobility goes to three fifth of cars .
you can make it <unk> : it &apos;s tougher than titan .
so trucks and planes can use realistic hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
it &apos;s also better light and <unk> and and so that <unk> <unk> by a third .
so , in about 20 <unk> , private solar cells , they have cheap solar cells , without financial losses on their roofs and and down their <unk> .
and what we &apos;re always replacing it is going to be about the same cost : about six trillion dollars in <unk> -- but we &apos;re buying more of what we have or new nuclear power or renewable <unk> , or renewable , which are more or less centralized .
so in results , and not incentives , to focus , can be <unk> and conflict to the <unk> solution .
and then i realized that what i had eaten , two <unk> of his family .
these simple <unk> shows that donors are in areas where the least children go to school , don &apos;t have a school , and this raises new questions . aid the the ones that need most need them ?
two years ago , on august 8 2010 2010 , i called my father .
i &apos;m not trying to design the toothbrush .
we remember , can this be a whole book of my <unk> son that life emerged four billion years ago -- four billion square years ago ?
that &apos;s kind of like , i &apos;m not sure .
there &apos;s risks . there &apos;s traps . one trap . the vertical .
you have time to think , you have time to do something about art and talk about things like this .
you go back to the future , back , back , like this .
they all come from families , and usually one person is home , usually the mother or grandmother , and they come to their education and their structure here .
we &apos;re going to bring them to the right and left , so they can tell the consequences and the consequences that they can tell the consequences .
let &apos;s all go online . &quot;
it &apos;s unpredictable .
they said , &quot; that &apos;s enough for <unk> .
you can support us . that &apos;s the job of you guys . &quot;
but i have to have my shake .
you can listen and join .
for instance , take the <unk> <unk> .
if you think about the concept of wikipedia , everyone &apos;s driving content content , and ultimately , the greatest encyclopedia in the world is .
there are many people who have the same dream .
it &apos;s created a website .
there was no leader .
extremism has become to tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience , we show us what happens there is an incredibly complex process .
we can hold out of our own language apart , but not the other languages .
we studied this by watching american babies who had never heard a second language at the beginning of the critical stage .
it may look like a <unk> from mars .
science on the one hand has a very rational approach to your surroundings , while art on the other side has an emotional approach to its environment .
now i have a <unk> over here to show you .
let me demonstrate this over here .
the dalai lama once said , &quot; love and compassion are <unk> .
the rags were burned by a little girl whose body was burned down .
it &apos;s part of every human <unk> .
and if compassion is so good for us , then why don &apos;t we choose compassion ?
the wound in front of predators .
if you may like canvas squares , and frankly , who doesn &apos;t like ?
we start with a <unk> , and then we turn another <unk> next to the next .
then there was <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
i said , &quot; he &apos;s dead .
&quot; have i got what &apos;s wrong ! &quot; &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t get an memo . what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you do here ? &quot;
so i went to the lobby , and i saw these indian guys .
marco tempest : so , if you asked him to deception , he said , &quot; magic is the only one ever ever ever .
where &apos;s the queen ?
i &apos;m going to demonstrate how closely terrorism is connected to our daily lives .
at the time i interviewed the red brigades , i also discovered that their life was not by ideology and politics , but was economic constraints .
i think a lot of people thought that even a little bit of <unk> .
but most of all , they went into serious crime with organized crime .
this money was taken in <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- in cash , understands .
nobody wants the <unk> to control his and control its <unk> with clients .
now some of you might think , &quot; wait a minute . it doesn &apos;t necessarily look like a <unk> .
sure , i wanted to leave my <unk> , but what i didn &apos;t know was that it was very confident to leave his <unk> .
and i really learned that , as the more challenge , the greater the challenge , the greater the feeling of a special performance if you get to the end .
well , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really very big .
but it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
it &apos;s this little green disk on the horizon , which makes it very nervous because of the rising level .
we can start to make better , more fulfilled , more choices .
<unk> <unk> : why i &apos;m talking about the pacific
this is the world trade <unk> on the cover page .
why ? why ? why do you want to do that ?
he doesn &apos;t see any surplus cost . it doesn &apos;t use any extra time .
they were able to make this .
and it &apos;s all about comfort , and it &apos;s about feeling good about places that they don &apos;t feel well well before .
and that &apos;s hard if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i wondered : how can it be so easy to give my dreams ?
it &apos;s not that hard to get somebody , and one day before school , i said , &quot; you can &apos;t do my homework , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answers that i had in the night before .
we both were <unk> up to the back benches in class so that we wouldn &apos;t be bombarded with <unk> .
maybe you &apos;ve brought your your <unk> and <unk> teeth , but never tell it about it , because how can you say , if all of you want to buried you ?
this is french science .
all right , go ahead .
if you look at this truck here ; it &apos;s the largest truck of its species on earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest and fastest-growing value of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s why canada is now number three in terms of <unk> per capita .
and as a father , i can &apos;t just imagine what that &apos;s doing .
by doing that , we remove a large part of our biggest <unk> and and replace them with the most greenhouse oil in the future .
the <unk> of your work is the <unk> that you can buy in every store and put the millions of indian women on their forehead every day , and it &apos;s a ritual that stands closely related to the institution of marriage .
<unk> shaw was born in <unk> , raised in <unk> and in london .
i hope you can convince you that complex and complicated are not the same thing .
the <unk> <unk> is the one we want to influence -- the public support for the government .
so i suggested to my first tedtalk that we should spend 21 billion hours a week on video games a week .
only 30 minutes of wages per day , they pay for a significant improvement in mood and <unk> increase of joy .
why a game ?
how could such a powerful effect in such serious serious , sometimes , <unk> situations ?
there are four types of starch , or resilience that contribute to post-traumatic growth , and there are scientifically <unk> things that you can do every day to build these resilience , you don &apos;t need a trauma .
it &apos;s more practice by getting it .
here &apos;s another secret for you , if you shake your hand for six seconds , the <unk> will be raised in your blood , the <unk> .
and in this project , we have now hundreds of people around the world , and we &apos;re doing that together , and actually thousands of people involved in this project , in many of their different aspects .
and then a couple of people came from chicago and said , &quot; at 2007 , the slogan of the chicago <unk> festival festival the global warming . we want a 3,000-square-foot gallery , and we want them fill them with their reef . &quot;
wool and <unk> are not two concepts that fit well .
<unk> asked , &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
infinitely . she <unk> . it &apos;s exactly .
so we &apos;ve come from , to build local <unk> , evidence that the most famous <unk> of mathematics is wrong .
and their individual imagination , and their engagement with this mathematical method .
this particular <unk> feature -- the self-confidence -- is , in my opinion , is the holy grail of neuroscience , neuroscience , and eventually we &apos;ll hope to understand what &apos;s going on .
this person is otherwise in <unk> wit and intelligent , but when he sees his mother , his accomplishments reaches his delusion , he says it &apos;s not his mother .
so if this area is damaged , you lose the ability to recognize faces .
tables and chairs and <unk> -- nothing happens , just like the ordinary people , but if i show him a picture of his mother , the <unk> remains low .
he knows that his arm is not there . nonetheless , it &apos;s a convincing , painful experience .
and you can see the <unk> that the spasm of the device in the phantom limb .
and my pain disappeared . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days i had no phantom limb , and so i don &apos;t have any <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> in the <unk> . all my pain disappeared .

well done .
he learned that if he put both hands , he would be able to do his own <unk> <unk> , much larger and more <unk> flakes .
a <unk> means a hut in the forest .
does he see where the sound comes from ?
because we believe it &apos;s not biology , it &apos;s the culture .
and some stars die in spectacular explosions that are pulling down these remains .
on the right-hand side , gravity is <unk> . einstein explains that .
and beyond that , it brings new ways of change .
and for that , it was too early , but he was a moral guide , a realization for scientists who were worried about control of the guns .
suppose aliens aliens have been looking at our <unk> point from far outside the cosmos , not not only for 40 years , but all the <unk> billion years of the earth &apos;s population .
martin rees : is this our last century ?
and it gets worse , &quot; then i would take a picture of it and make a dozen <unk> .
well , these are students , so they gave a lot of money for things like <unk> and make-up .
and then we asked them again how happy they are .
but enormously different motivations .
these are <unk> in belgium .
the teams that we gave for money to spend on each other , become other teams , and actually at the end , the league .
now , when we hear hearing about the <unk> from the high school , the high school , we often believe that this is one of those wondrous conflicts of the middle east , whose roots are the same .
ironically , it was a time when the <unk> of iran was peace with washington peace , and not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that &apos;s intended to take out diplomacy . is diplomacy is inevitable .
you can look at certain levels of information , or you can look at the different regions and compare them .
the map of port <unk> at the end of 2009 , was not as good as you could have , not as good as the map of california .
the trick is this .
to the explanation , she said , &quot; he was not a environmentalists . &quot;
this system wants to keep the status quo , also the status quo , the status quo .
so it &apos;s not that my theme is important . it &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , the citizens , have to take the republic
for example , some people in this room are given to a scholarship to school for a scholarship .
that &apos;s on my pen anyway . &quot;
everybody is just a little bit of a .
i don &apos;t want to say that the law of entropy is not true , it &apos;s true .
this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
if you see in the middle of north america , they &apos;re like so many things in the united states , they &apos;re active each other . they ignore each other .
each of their <unk> depends on this critical region , the <unk> , which is about 10,000 independent cells , each of which any <unk> , a electronic rhythm -- a high tension , a low -- to send the <unk> to the pump .
they were a while , <unk> , but apart .
so i want to show you a couple of interviews with people who were to the opening up on the bridge and describe what happened .
now , you don &apos;t normally think of a metronome , but we all walk -- we &apos;re running back and running back .
am : it &apos;s just a few tons , so you &apos;re going to go pretty quickly .
it &apos;s the <unk> scientist in his field .
i didn &apos;t tell what the list was , but she was in <unk> order , and i told them they should look for their names , their <unk> , or the <unk> of their mother .
perhaps , this <unk> , or perhaps a <unk> , which is not worth economically , is an resilience against disease or pests or another property that is useful for climate change and the others don &apos;t have .
we &apos;re going to see kids in television .
so the idea with svalbard is that it &apos;s cold , so you have natural temperature below the surface of the water .
and if anything happens , you can come and pick it up .
thank you .
watch your posture ! this one &apos;s not right .
maybe any lady , one lady ? thank you .
you just tried two concepts -- two in the u.s. , one in the russians .
madness ! i have to talk briefly about innovation -- things are evolving , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then they &apos;re replaced by something else and they die .
i can &apos;t tell you when it comes out because i don &apos;t want the competition to know my schedule .
i mean something really interesting that &apos;s going to happen here .
ok , let &apos;s talk a little bit more about the commercial development of the space sector .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give , but he &apos;s got a epiphany .
institutions become naked , and if you &apos;re naked , you know , the consequences .
the fourth meaning of openness and fourth principle is <unk> .
the toothpaste is from the <unk> .
they know that bees and fish live in in .
we have a medical revolution , a revolution , a revolution that will help us beat some of the worst diseases of our society , including cancer .
this is a tumor , dark , gray , a <unk> mass , <unk> in a brain .
and you can see that the ring of the blood supply after the treatment goes after the treatment .
but the real question is : how well do they work in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens if we add a <unk> , it &apos;s actually <unk> angiogenesis in a very efficient way .
but even more interesting from the study came out that the men who evolved <unk> , who , who have taken more tomato sauce , were actually less blood vessels that they feed their cancer .
albert von <unk> once said that &quot; discoveries are to see what everyone has seen , and think , what nobody else thought . &quot;
i &apos;m a <unk> magazine .
it &apos;s got to be fun , unlike any common problem , which frankly , are not very <unk> puzzles .
one is the background of the other .
you can &apos;t do that physically , but on a computer it &apos;s going to be . over to the computer .
i wanted to make a sequel .
which direction of the will you fall here ?
so there are games like &quot; brain age &quot; for the nintendo <unk> , a <unk> .
looks like a black character . where is that ?
i really believe that a girl is so powerful that we had to train all of us to not be like this .
i remember , for example , when my father , who was very , very violent , was me .
we &apos;re so used to being girls of the <unk> , being <unk> of their own life , that we actually actually made them to objects and now turned them into .
and she looked into her baby &apos;s eyes and said , &quot; of course i love my baby . how could i love my baby ?
when we were there , she did a ritual where they were <unk> , who were <unk> with their families .
and i &apos;m going to be on your side for the rest of your life . &quot;
i love that i don &apos;t take things easy .
why should they want to <unk> me ?
so , the actual process , all the six teenagers said they were the <unk> they made by the photo .
but the incident was coming in january of january , on the northern hemisphere , at 7 o &apos;clock at night .
this is 10 feet away .
and what is this example of -- what is important for us to remember memory ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a <unk> and i went through africa a year , where i asked people why they built fractals , which is a great job if you can get it .
and that &apos;s going on in some villages to the smallest level .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the jungle , i would use just a long time paw , because it &apos;s very fast and it &apos;s very cheap .
just and odd yield odd .
we have a <unk> in ghana .
but the bad news is .
instead of looking at friends or relatives , they looked at <unk> jobs .
today , development development is applied in a hundred countries , and it &apos;s going to go up to the <unk> .
fear of losing the <unk> . it &apos;s going to take beds .
we &apos;re putting a couple of rules on and we hold them .
the conversation gets going to be better . &quot;
just when i was driving to come here tonight , i started to get one of my daughters .
and we developed 10 statements .
i was a teenager when i first read &quot; anna <unk> , &quot; the famous first sentence , read , &quot; all happy families share each other .
i want to show you how something unseen can look so beautiful .
if i put this in the water , you can see a <unk> <unk> , and this <unk> is the <unk> that breaks the water from the ross sea shelf . it stays dry .
and plato with all the young boys in his cave . sweeney : <unk> ...
i &apos;ll show you .
but tesla &apos;s success was not a .
one thing i want to make right is that not all <unk> <unk> .
we can turn them up or sit , or , or make it .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i &apos;ve shown you that we can apply it to the circuits of the mood of depression .
we &apos;re understanding what these circuits are , and what are the areas of the clinical signs and symptoms of those diseases .
evolution is actually actually like a <unk> as a engineer .
that &apos;s enough !
what we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human like richard , or a cockroach or a crab , or a <unk> , the relative <unk> of that feather is right for those of us that we &apos;ve seen before .
ok . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , right ? it &apos;s amazing , and they tried it , and they couldn &apos;t say it .
he does this with a <unk> glue .
what we do is we take the hair as a role model , and then we put them together with a different colleague of berkeley .
showed that by the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the men , the children of the men who have kids , but only one third of the <unk> women .
on monday , i left san francisco , my <unk> , and flew to this conference .
and we go out at the end , look at and say , &quot; how did it go to you ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study at harvard business school about a woman called heidi <unk> .
and i put my hand back and i noticed that in all other women , and then you &apos;ve thought of questions , just men . &quot;
and a woman contacted me and i looked at her -- she looked a little young .
thank you .
they don &apos;t usually do it as well as they should , but they do .
so fear was the <unk> factor .
but it &apos;s the black black .
so i want to talk about this , thinking about how we &apos;re spreading information in this country , how we get to information .
so they &apos;re in <unk> , very powerful language , and that works .
we tell them that everything is okay ; it &apos;s fine to you .
so the patient is about 50 , so we can actually tell the extent of how big his risk is to get prostate cancer .
you don &apos;t need the <unk> of the audience in this room .
and this bee had certainly assumed , &quot; i &apos;m now going to take this <unk> , this flower , i &apos;ll get the nectar , and then i &apos;ll get off . &quot;
and when you talk about nature , the author is my favorite favorite , what is the idea of the <unk> ?

the only technology here is the cheap <unk> : pretty new , attached to a <unk> , even i could put a <unk> for 10 to 15 minutes in 15 minutes .
when a <unk> <unk> , the grass will be on this <unk> , and it &apos;s something interesting to happen .
and now i &apos;m saying that i want to build a layer of games on the world , but it &apos;s not quite true , because it &apos;s already in development ; it &apos;s happening .
if it isn &apos;t , it &apos;s a shame . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
come on a certain time , get your drinks for half a price .
and then they can do really good in different ways .
and it &apos;s powerful .
<unk> is a non-zero-sum dynamic that tries to find the best news , the most exciting stories .
we talked to you last couple of years ago .
you can also see that , when i turn this around -- hopefully i don &apos;t have the world too much .
you can see here it started .
this is one of our engineers .
<unk> , who should have taught <unk> students , discovered the law of the <unk> , just like a hobby .
raise your hands .
it makes it a place where it makes fun .
and so that &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on , and we even have people who are excited about this and crazy enough , that they &apos;re really passionate about that .
thank you .
and what brunel said , for his riders , was the experience of packing through the landscape .
what makes life easier , more motivated ?
and part of it , they <unk> this by building a great new device , using the basement of one of their hospitals .
today , the industrial systems of the time have been <unk> and indeed , in fact , the current problem .
and as brunel , we can do it by <unk> on systems , we have a bigger effect .
from my persistence , the waiter <unk> himself with his <unk> .
mark <unk> , and i tried to try to answer the question of studies to answer this question .
yet , it &apos;s exactly what american paradigm demands .
but for the <unk> , the hydrothermal availability of all these <unk> on the market like a <unk> .
americans themselves discover that unlimited choices in the theory seem more attractive than in practice .
<unk> parents would say more things like , &quot; noah was only for that short time , but he taught us so much .
robert frost once said this , &quot; it &apos;s poetry that goes through translation . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant <unk> of pink . &quot;
the three problems have one common : they &apos;re more problems that are controlled by nature .
so thank you very much .
it &apos;s to replace competition by collaboration .
and then we build a <unk> , which we can test the highest performance of the tools , and we can get very , very quickly .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the best of the <unk> is not understood as a <unk> , but as a <unk> movement .
the bomb enters the stage .
and then the 92 nuclear energy that would put the energy , the rest of los angeles .
then you take it and put it on the screen , and you put it in the back of the , and you &apos;re just like this .
if you replace the word , or the present internet , it &apos;s very really that its attitude now is very <unk> . let &apos;s hear it .
i think it was this exchange that led to computer graphics .
ph : i hope you &apos;ll see how <unk> this is .
and finally , race is going to win the future of momentum , the phone company .
mm : because there &apos;s a the audience to do something .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and where tv has been built , which is built , a very exciting new kind of communications , and we have the <unk> of two industries and a new way of thinking about it .
this is an spanish architect and designer .
color can be simple blocks , simple materials : if i go through new york , i &apos;m on .
and i &apos;ve given suggestions -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we all talk about and build a few installations .
the dedication that the city for public space has been important , is to be almost an international model .
even the parts of the airplane had french names .
he said , &quot; well , first , there &apos;s more girls there . &quot;
and that &apos;s , as i , , after some <unk> and <unk> , where the design of the chair ended i &apos;m going to show you .
he said you have one of the new , more chairs .
or they pull up into the position position .
i knew , but i was in the offices , and when i was in the offices , where there was no anyone to come to the idea of conduct , to turn on a <unk> and to fit the headrest to bring them to position .
and dengue fever has spread in <unk> .
two days ago or yesterday , i can &apos;t remember myself , i read in a <unk> , that <unk> has the first <unk> of <unk> , about 52 <unk> cases , with about 400 breeds of cases .
we need something that really <unk> the <unk> so that it doesn &apos;t spread the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males hit female , every lot of offspring .
so rovs are not our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; why ? &quot; why ? &quot;
and most of the time , i &apos;m not going to do it even though i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> .
look at the data data .
well , our mobile phones now can now a a story of our <unk> .
bill <unk> : your health depends on where you live .
this is my grandfather .
because of the simple reason , no one else talks about it .
as the <unk> explains , plants are moving from the ground .
here &apos;s the title of an remarkable article from a <unk> of a <unk> of the , which is the discussion about the phosphorus crisis .
80 percent of them are already going to be lost .
and instead of 100 percent of the percent , we take one percent of them .
we have a working technology and one that is used by <unk> use some of the <unk> that we &apos;re going to do on the world &apos;s atmosphere .
and he was a <unk> <unk> , he looked at all the <unk> and mutations to find rules and laws , rather than looking at the norms .
and in this example , you see the individual stages repeat , but they repeat without being <unk> .
as an architect , i think of relationships between the parts of the divide and the whole , but in terms of design , it &apos;s going to be a business for companies .
we were looking at the level of the building of the building , where we could build the five separate towers , but they should all joined on the curved floor to a single <unk> mass .
come back , a few years later , in 2003 , and we &apos;ll see this landscape actually looks rather than <unk> than a rainforest .
the difference is mostly in <unk> in the desert , or maybe <unk> in <unk> , whatever you want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that have been released illegal and now are at the air .
we &apos;ve doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world , just by fertilizers that are huge problems in water quality , in rivers , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important thing for <unk> .
but we can do that , and there are opportunities to do it .
irrigation is the biggest <unk> on the <unk> .
work together .
so -- what is actually the thing that is really involved ?
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
the whole system doesn &apos;t pay taxes .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological economic to reinforce these <unk> -- muscles .
this is what it looks like .
here we are , or cut the nerve free , from small parts of the <unk> and and other posters , we gave us our <unk> -- signal -- two others that tie our hand to us -- signal signal .
ak : it works well .
but i can &apos;t put up electrode and say , &quot; go . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal -- to have a clinically <unk> .
this is jesse , and he presses a <unk> .
so thank you .
sub-saharan africa is this condition , because there are 22 million people living with hiv , and that &apos;s a million percent of the 30 million people who are infected around the world .
governments in the site need to create effective <unk> for ethical aspects in clinical trials that are authorized in the different developing world , and <unk> , which are <unk> by the government and the <unk> of the trial .
the fundamental problems we face with are a high consumption and too many people .
so they all make all criteria that usually like people .
so you can see that power that goes north -- the <unk> in this case -- which is to the galapagos , and this <unk> , the <unk> , which starts up in the galapagos .
we also know that not only are <unk> , but they &apos;re also as magellanic and other <unk> .
i want to show you penguins that penguins are moved in <unk> .
turbo himself himself to pat up his <unk> with his <unk> , and we &apos;ll go in and he comes in .
and then there &apos;s another one who &apos;s really pretty close to the .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we don &apos;t solved : our basic policy .
they &apos;re going to share a pretty long frontier .
again , in the case of mongolia , china didn &apos;t conquered russia . it &apos;s <unk> .
for <unk> countries , china reduced its <unk> , so that <unk> and cambodia were able to sell their goods cheaper and <unk> from <unk> to china .
so , what i want to introduce you to is , i call <unk> , day after day .
these two arrows form a bow , a bow of <unk> and other infrastructure that connects the west bank with the gaza satellite .
a lot of them .
so what &apos;s next ? what &apos;s the future of european union ?
53 countries , and far , most of the suspects are lines on the map .
this dream exists its <unk> .
is it bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone receptor is promotes growth .
so how can a hormone eventually turn the speed of aging ?
we think that insulin and igf-1 are hormones that are particularly active in the circumstances -- in good times -- if food is available to the , and not much stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details of how it works , but we know that foxo genes have a impact on life expectancy of people .
it could be <unk> genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process of which i &apos;ve been talking about , which is in the worm , has a different normal , like a bird , so that the bird can live much longer .
you will never see a ad like this because nike wants you to buy your shoes .
they all show heroes that have been <unk> .
it &apos;s like trying to run against a <unk> .
this view is that many <unk> <unk> like prozac are basically changing the chemistry of the brain as if in fact , the brain of the chemical soup would be .
and my colleague colleague seymour <unk> believes that .
and so through the <unk> , we found that an mutant , much longer needed to <unk> , and as we were <unk> the genes that were playing in this mutation , we could find a <unk> .
now , this question is you &apos;ve been asking for a long time in humans , but in flight , we can actually test it .
so , anyway , mosquitoes are finding us in the dark by <unk> us . they smell us .
just to you it , this is the cheese .
people even said to me that they &apos;re now going to be bitten by mosquitos .
in <unk> .
and every time i had the <unk> look at the eyes of the eyes , i was behind .
and as it turns out , fat is one of the best sources for adult stem cells .
while we speak , about <unk> clinical trials are research to use the use of stem cells for <unk> .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the ability to have this angel in the world , not just in our country : venezuela , in our world .
so what happens if this doesn &apos;t happen ?
but here you see what &apos;s really on .
i can &apos;t tell you anything about this because i stopped the headline .
<unk> <unk> : what they don &apos;t know about marriage
but how ?
it &apos;s even better . it seems that we can make these receivers using the materials that dna is encoded in .
the animal knows , it &apos;s pouring out its wings , it &apos;s <unk> it , but it can &apos;t really erase it , because the fly is caught between two .
for a intelligent creature like our fly , this rule is not in stone , but changes as the animal learns through experience .
through many such experiments , we were able to put the identity of the critic to 12 to 12 cells .
there are a few ideas in the biology and artificial intelligence , how to do that , but we still haven &apos;t solved one example of the , like intelligent behavior of the physical interaction on living matter .
here &apos;s libby , or actually a <unk> of libby .
ed : all right . tb : okay . so , look , a little bit closer , a little bit closer to the middle .
and from your experience , i know that hospitals can be a very dangerous place for young people .
here &apos;s a picture of my legacy of legacy .
one of them , i &apos;m telling you , this kind of <unk> that is all intertwined , from your goals to your genes , will transform the <unk> transformation that we &apos;re going to see in our lifetime of healthcare .
they &apos;re not going to do a velcro or a <unk> or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc <unk> built the <unk> <unk> .
what would happen if you had to go to the bottom of the bed and it would come up with a <unk> or we would shake the leaf ? &quot;
and so , <unk> did . and he does this .
of course , completely different than you would see this in a <unk> .
we &apos;re going to look at rising levels .
and i would say , people who are working in the ocean and thinking about goals , we think they should be much lower .
this is the ship that i was the last three months in antarctica .
ice ice ice is melting up at sea level by six meters .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news for the corals of galapagos islands .
their relationship is the temperature .
but then at the end , you see the <unk> in black black .
we have very interesting opportunities to the co2 in the atmosphere of millions of years , and we &apos;ve only done it only with <unk> , but in this case we &apos;re going to go back 20 million years .
and this is the task that einstein asked : figure out how gravity works .
einstein had already had room and time , warps and curves to describe gravity .
but deep deep in the structure of the room , the idea , could be more dimensions than we see there .
and just as the strings of a cello , different , the only spores can vibrate in different patterns .
yet .
is this just an interesting mathematical apparatus that may be able to explain some of the <unk> of the world , or can we actually reveal these extra dimensions ?
so we have two sheets of tiles on the slide here .
now , can it be the predator , which is , attacking them ?
and what &apos;s true for sensory information is generally true for all .
and we look at about 30 seconds of what a hammer is in a 18 minutes a long time .
why ? because if the chemical in this shadows was actually in the shadows and reflecting the same amount of light on your eye like the external outside of the shadow , they would have to reflect more -- just after laws of physics .
how do you know this ?
and she comes in the hive , finds a void <unk> and and food -- and that &apos;s honey .
he finds him . madness , right ?
do you agree ? yes ?
there &apos;s no right there , no right there .
in 2010 , not so much .
we &apos;re also a species of storytellers .
now some things : understanding of security , the risks , the risks , the <unk> , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the many risks that we have faced with .
think of cancer , avian flu , swine flu .
there was no new insights , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i call it <unk> , by accepting data that shows our <unk> and data data suggesting our our <unk> .
i grabbed another group , and i was able to determine if my airplane was safe to fly .
this is what people people .
and he was here in the nearby , at stanford .
they had good revelations with their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions to figure out if that &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
i assumed anybody to get them to get them or save them , where i could get up as volunteer , but i found that nobody did .
we opened the first section of 2009 .
robert <unk> : building a park in the sky
and groups were often called &quot; terrorists . &quot;
you need a <unk> process that which the core of this very complicated society can deal with its problems .
it &apos;s about the first time in the history of the arab world a revolution of the ground , a <unk> .
but , the last decade , the <unk> decade was so generous .
suddenly , the ngos were not just fighting their <unk> anymore , but they took them into negotiations , part of the negotiation , because they were the victims of these weapons .
thank you very much .
but i don &apos;t think that &quot; <unk> &quot; is something good .
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little bit crazy to work on a new <unk> .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange rich man in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the the last day , the sun comes out , the <unk> come , they come right to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i admit i &apos;m a little nervous here because i &apos;m going to tell you some radical things about how we &apos;re supposed to think differently from cancer to an audience that many people have , who know , more than i do .
the part of the genome we can read is the list of ingredients .
there &apos;s a huge amount of information in genetics by just comparing the genetic resemblance to the brain .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; okay , at least this guy is good connected . &quot;
so we &apos;re basically measuring every single thing as a own .
if you have malaria , we &apos;ll give you <unk> , some of them .
where do we really need to get out of the process that &apos;s happening on the right , and at the level of the <unk> activity on the level of why the body is not restricted itself , how does he normally take ? ? &quot;
danny hillis : cancer by proteomics
they &apos;re all members of tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to just give these people .
because at stage three , most of us are .
this is their lobby .
there was no plan . never before tried to try .
in fact , martin luther kings was sentence in stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m doing nothing . &quot;
and all of a sudden , they came out the <unk> , trying to figure out , &quot; how do we ask the population of sub-saharan africa ? &quot;
automatically , we <unk> the little bits of plastic up .
these <unk> or <unk> <unk> , were designed to <unk> up to the ground to <unk> the taxes for the ground that they &apos;re on , weren &apos;t <unk> buildings .
it <unk> the stability and security that can offer the lap of a uncle , you compare them to the <unk> construction of a <unk> niece in high school .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the most important form of <unk> gratification .
i can &apos;t really explain it , and he doesn &apos;t .
stories like these , signs like this , are practical to contribute in a world that yearns for compassion , the most <unk> images of suffering that may otherwise be us .
and gandhi was a really <unk> person .
and the first day our <unk> had <unk> us , and we taught our slogan that we had to spend every day for the rest of the summer to make the <unk> .
this is one of two or three of her famous .
here are some examples .
it turns out we can &apos;t be part of a group without <unk> the opinion of others .
so this is the world we live in today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn my grandfather in my own way .
okay , number two : go into the wild .
and imagine that , imagine a inner picture : i was born in a very small village in mexico , in , unfortunately , very <unk> , and my parents had no higher education .
and so we think that through all the changes that have happened that we are now incredible opportunities .
it &apos;s an initiative that &apos;s on simple , <unk> , and <unk> solutions .
we &apos;ve got 30 different technologists now in 18 different countries , and we were able to connect millions of people , in the effort of learning to continue to learn what this particular segment needs and demands .
and on my <unk> , my father came to me and said , &quot; you know , i remember remember every generation has to do better than the previous one .
i know a lot of people who are very smart and still say , &quot; why can &apos;t i solve my problem ? &quot;
i started them with a family in 1980 .
do you think we &apos;re having responsibility to take the seriousness seriously ? &quot;
i &apos;m still driving the same four years ford ford , as well .
but that &apos;s not a good life .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s praying .
whether or not they believe it or not , don &apos;t make any difference for me now .
so he said , &quot; what do you think in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s this in your hand ? &quot; -- i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and this basketball is represents your identity , what you &apos;re .
and when my kids were little , i always went to her room , sat down on her bed , and i looked at my kids .
it &apos;s less than i had <unk> -- i <unk> with three to 10 million -- but yet it &apos;s a very powerful number .
and then in a village , we have 100 laptops , each one with a different collection of 100 books , so that the village has suddenly 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese character for <unk> .
and they answer the question : how does it feel that you &apos;re behaving ?
we &apos;re really learning this really bad lesson .
think about a moment of what it &apos;s like to feel at the right .
and unlike any other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with trying to figure out out .
and i have to tell you that i thought i was writing this incredibly <unk> book on a subject that everybody hates , for an audience that would never be .
the effect of that , of course , is not just <unk> wheat , but mountains of grains .
1986 , she came from vietnam to america .
and the answer to that was , &quot; that &apos;s even worse . &quot;
our <unk> dropped to a third of the dotcom in our industry , and in the five years of the dotcom system , our <unk> <unk> .
and bhutan , for those of you who don &apos;t know , is the youngest democracy in the world , just two years old .
it &apos;s actually that in the west , we &apos;re often hunting after happiness , than if happiness is something we have to capture , or maybe a lot of things we need to get .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we really need to learn as leaders , is that we can manipulate the production of production by creating the right conditions so that our employees can live their calling .
bl : all right . one , two , two .
under deck of deck you will tell you the <unk> , moving moving , but the eyes are moving in the boat and saying , &quot; i &apos;m quiet . &quot;
amy , you you come up ?
the method : what did you do ? what &apos;s you have seen ?
i &apos;m just reading one .
real scientific education should give people a voice and give them a voice to it , and so amy , amy the last word in this short story .
poor people have no choice of choice .
we were in the 70s 70s .
and to get out there , we have to recognize that the principle of a <unk> is not just the kind of constituency we talked about , but our society also .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure anybody of you have been wondering , &quot; yes , great things up there -- but how come i come up ?
i was a professor at the <unk> davis , and i got a lot of attention to that , and that allowed me to fund the launch of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they fall apart , and they end up here .
i mean , people wonder , are cell phones safe .
you have a coil .
because remember the original idea of dr. <unk> : the <unk> mobile phone .
and for those who can &apos;t read it , it says , &quot; it seems like it &apos;s actually a kind of <unk> technology . &quot;
green or natural <unk> , where not being <unk> , are a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the <unk> poisons in our bodies .
first , a <unk> , <unk> with <unk> , the <unk> death .
only months later , i learned who he really was .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; hold it alive if you can . &quot;
even with this <unk> paper in our hands , we have the hope to redefine hope again .
it &apos;s a feature .
suddenly he knows that he &apos;s defeated .
to give you a little bit of this , we have to put it back on the driver &apos;s side .
we <unk> the area , we <unk> it , we sent people in , we put the buildings in the inside , the <unk> , and we helped the first <unk> , the search and the rescue .
when i do this , i don &apos;t lose the original details , in the contrary , i could write history here .
you &apos;re withheld by public opinion .
it &apos;s not very good .
and one of them is a democracy .
here &apos;s the question : what country does it stop , china , or india ?
because the indian man has a benefit of two years to the indian woman .
in terms of political change , they introduced <unk> .
china , i think , has still been some of the most important , <unk> , -- especially in terms of social capital , public health , a sense of equality that &apos;s not in india .
it was a place where people with <unk> and with various <unk> and and <unk> .
and now you have the problem that you spent the whole money on doing this progressive electronics in these countries , and now everything is <unk> .
a little <unk> environment , where many ideas came from where people had more , interesting , interesting , <unk> -- people .
about one decade ago , a wonderful discussion of <unk> came up with the name of howard <unk> , and darwin &apos;s notebook from that period .
they were <unk> in their colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , no , i didn &apos;t think about it .
but also , also the other way ?
in the 1970s , the one percent of the national income in the united states .
many of these political factors can be summarized in the category of crony capitalism , political authority , who are helping a group of good to connect together , but nothing good for the rest of us .
as you &apos;re quite easily watching how globalization and technological revolution make this global rule of money , it &apos;s much harder to judge the whole .
so they &apos;re investing unprecedented amounts of time and tools to train their children .
we created the modern <unk> .
that &apos;s his little hand .
one of them , we &apos;re all going to die .
that was a huge disappointment for us , because we believed in a new development .
i think even in places like oregon , where you can take <unk> and make a toxic dose , only half a percent people have ever done .
so , long talk , they come to a .
but i heard about cancer as the most <unk> disease of our time , so how did the good and the bad one ?
and some article even went to say that <unk> is resistant to cancer , and beyond , not only to cancer , but it &apos;s spreading metastases from skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! that there are these <unk> tumors in skeletal muscle , but only 16 percent of the real metastases -- which suggests that skeletal muscle may be able to control angiogenesis , to control the tumors that are feeding these blood vessels .
it &apos;s a very far conceptual idea , but i really believe that &apos;s possible .
and then my translator left me .
she was the girl who had the other in the room to her team .
and right on that , i wrote a letter to my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had a <unk> son .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator .
so the two came to lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had children from korea in korea , and he found families for them .
they have a lot of time on the dictionary .
so i open this window , look out , look out , see how flames of the side of the hotels suck down the height . the hotel burning .
so we ran into the bathroom , took towels and kept them in front of our faces and the children .
until the adoption is through . one year . what does that long ?
this is their <unk> .
this is sydney , who &apos;s going to be three years old .
but there was no evidence .
there &apos;s little planets , there &apos;s bigger planets , there &apos;s great planets , ok .
but there &apos;s a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something that depends on the planet ?
and that deeper <unk> , the point is that the science is about defining the life , as we know it .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , okay , from here to there .
thank you very much .
look at the u.k. during uganda , <unk> <unk> , russia to one percent .
they find the highest hiv rates in the world in african countries , and yet they find in senegal , the same , the same rate as in the united states .
look at kenya .
it may be something else , the transmission of the transmission is more likely .
we know that about <unk> billion people have ever lived .
it was not just economic story .
and the result is even a greater divergence in a shorter period than it was in germany .
it &apos;s the same with institutions .
you just have to give me to eat . &quot;
he was wrong .
now , i want to end with three questions about the future billion , just before 2016 , when the united states lose its place as a number of economy in china .
no , we &apos;ll be able to make the <unk> , notwithstanding the huge <unk> that we &apos;ve been carrying , despite the evidence that we &apos;ve lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical <unk> .
niall , thank you .
there are many kinds of silks .
spider silk is almost entirely from protein .
the fibers that can make a single spider are pretty diverse .
moreover , <unk> have a huge potential for the ability to move on .
what i &apos;m going to do is not the <unk> , as beautiful as it may be , but to the photos .
you have to have physical structure .
there are more photos . there &apos;s more photographers .
that sounds strange in our ears , but what happened is 80 percent of the <unk> <unk> have contributed a lot .
the first thing that happens when you &apos;re a problem with the problem of the institution , the first goal of the institution is to move to preservation .
the inventor doesn &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states who are trying to figure out whether or not there are listeners .
it was created by making the use of the <unk> , the use of many of these tools , and no doubt the intelligence agencies today the world today the the attacks for the attacks last week .
you have <unk> , which is probably probably the most <unk> part of bread or the fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers because it &apos;s made of fibers .
everything is in its place . first plane .
we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but let &apos;s look at the different steps , under the <unk> of the possible connection to a deeper level -- my search is about to answer the question , &quot; what is so special about bread ? &quot;
this is transformation , two different things .
and if they &apos;re shaped , they go back to prove that they &apos;re alive and they develop character .
if you make this bread , you can use any kind of towel from any beer .
it will be a kind of <unk> , as we &apos;re working through this talk .
it takes very , very long to write these scores , and at the time i &apos;m working on a piece that is 180 pages long , and that &apos;s a big part of my life , and i &apos;m going to <unk> the hair .
it &apos;s demonstrated by brian <unk> who is an extraordinary artist .
so this gives you a little <unk> of the piece .
what we did -- betty <unk> , one of my students , and i -- we gave the babies two bowls to eat : a bowl with <unk> broccoli , and a bowl with <unk> <unk> .
i mean , ultimately , when we look at babies , we look pretty useless .
and our babies and children are much longer on us than the babies of each other species .
the <unk> is you to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
boy : that &apos;s why .
we &apos;re about this thing about this thing , and it &apos;s <unk> , and everything else is going to be like dark .
&quot; babies and young children are like the research and <unk> of human species , &quot; the <unk> alison <unk> . their research studies how babies do , and make decisions and make decisions .
if i could borrow for a little bit of a little demonstration for the difference -- because it &apos;s actually rather trivial .
and then you repeatedly download this process over and over again , until something <unk> comes out -- in this case , the figure is like me , walk straight .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
you can &apos;t do that at the far .
so here are some simple scenes that he &apos;s going to be .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we did it anyway .
some studios already use our software to do this exactly that , and we &apos;ll soon get a few of our <unk> into a few big <unk> .
we thought he was just going to hold the balance .
here you can learn to go to the <unk> -- as most of you may know .
but i have to say , i &apos;ll never forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i believe that art and creativity are absolutely essential to develop empathy .
if you &apos;re ever lonely , you write a new york times , you get hundreds of emails , and most of what i &apos;ve done today is covering frustration of frustration .
but some stories are just classic , but they &apos;re so common .
it &apos;s <unk> . nobody bought it .
there &apos;s a limit that we don &apos;t want to cross . so what &apos;s the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to make a new blank document in word -- that could be .
but i think there are actually two main points .
the other products were supported by microsoft with an open standard , rather than making apple <unk> .
and <unk> , if someone writes me a <unk> -- what happens every day -- i say , &quot; screw me . &quot;
but as i looked at the irreducible technologies , nanotechnology , <unk> and others in the <unk> species of digital technologies , i worried about the <unk> .
and to put the risk of these new things , we ultimately have to limit the ability of the individuals that are basically giving them access to <unk> power .
i think the challenge that we &apos;re facing -- i &apos;m very sure that &apos;s going to happen -- the challenge is that we &apos;re going to develop these <unk> with the background that will take us from this device to be <unk> ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , <unk> , you have all kinds of incredible properties .
and to give you a sense of the last of the tools -- it &apos;s got to 400 million dollars , so it &apos;s quite remarkable for us .
and if you use the concept of <unk> larger , you can actually produce a much more <unk> -- the entity of the marketplace -- use to deliver feedback .
i started to <unk> about 12 years ago , and i was bringing my research into this direction .
so wonderful and beautiful things .
there &apos;s ice below the surface .
so they &apos;re a <unk> form of life .
in fact , there &apos;s so much energy for biology in this cave that there &apos;s actually a large number of <unk> .
we can see them .
we noticed that a few years ago that caves have many properties that were used in the people and other organisms used to be habitat .
every time you put a goal , you have to have some steps to its own , , certain steps .
and so , in archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
and they were being taken and it suffered under tremendous <unk> .
that means , before we could start to digitize the <unk> , we had to take the book apart .
and this is what it looks like .
but by the electrons around light , they &apos;re <unk> off .
this was a bad idea , because <unk> of philip had a son called alexander the great , and they lost the battle of <unk> .
because the moment , institutions are using their data with <unk> and so on .
the original owners of the bottle was one of the most <unk> <unk> of the 18th century .
i asked myself , 160 dollars for something like that ?
it has four balconies .
a <unk> schematic is that many of these things come from japan -- you &apos;ll notice it .
i mean , a <unk> , <unk> toilet .
there was an object i couldn &apos;t get into the finger , and that was the <unk> cheval blanc .
and i can &apos;t -- call my taste of flavor -- so it &apos;s not necessarily relevant that i wasn &apos;t impressed , but i wasn &apos;t the only there , with this reaction .
at the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid sells for <unk> real dollars .
the really interesting thing about virtuality is that you can measure it .
now , i could develop a game called <unk> , by just having to get a million pies , or a thousand pies .
if it &apos;s real boxes , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game we say , &quot; ok . &quot;
this is absolutely crucial and virtuality is gorgeous in it .
and i want to tell you a little bit about the story , 1999 -- there was a video game called <unk> .
it &apos;s about how individual engagement can be transformed through the psychological and neurological insights that we get when we watch people play .
it &apos;s a kind of <unk> <unk> called officially as a <unk> .
i &apos;m a , and i &apos;m totally obsessed with diet .
there are certainly a million people in america , 49 million people , and almost <unk> million children .
and their farms are also big .
it &apos;s the 30th anniversary of <unk> grain and the big <unk> , by chicken <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in america and the change of the way we were post-conflict .
this is a <unk> that i received two years ago . this was in one of the largest projects i &apos;ve been and my company ever involved .
but i &apos;m going to go through the beginning of the process , three very <unk> .
if we &apos;re so good at what we do , we shouldn &apos;t be able to create an architectural manifestation that is utterly <unk> through the <unk> and <unk> bottlenecks ?
architectural practice was , <unk> , simple .
and this is the actual papers of the .
the second technology we we use , because we use things that you know from the <unk> of a opera .
here you see the <unk> configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about how you &apos;re telling stories , in a very <unk> way .
so one of the projects is about a year and a half .
these are the images automatically created by the machine .
as long as i was awake , i had the camera around the neck .
you can see a timeline that shows you the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s <unk> . you know , go on .
a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
a <unk> , <unk> farmer .
what if they found the truth of the truth , what would they do for the next 35 years of their life ?
&quot; money and open and open a business &quot; was the indian <unk> .
and while the was , he told them he wanted to be there , and he had given me a <unk> of <unk> .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it &apos;s not a good thing .
and the hand is almost impossible , except in <unk> , and then the communication is limited .
very funny people , if lol means that .
you don &apos;t make it .
if somebody had seen a black board of 1993 in 1993 , the <unk> had been a little different different from the time of the love of the , but he would have understood what was there .
i &apos;m about the <unk> , i wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can look at my work next week at whitney <unk> , and also in <unk> <unk> .
afghanistan is not an existential threat to global security .
and the same thing is true of the troops .
instead , there was a <unk> of <unk> optimism .
diplomats are in <unk> .
and finally , we have to understand that the secret of what we did in bosnia and kosovo , the secret of our success was in our humility -- in the careful <unk> way of our our hands .
rory , she &apos;s leaving libya .
so here &apos;s two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger , to show you what it looks like .
there are also <unk> that are <unk> , but when you go through these <unk> , they &apos;re used for a different kind of <unk> .
the <unk> . this is a difficult problem for reasons that i &apos;m not going to be <unk> .
there &apos;s one other , very interesting connection here , and this is that what you want to do is to lead valuable information about a general , fairly bad .
so , i think it &apos;s got the minimal food that we can probably achieve to make things .
and we &apos;ve decided that we should not think about it as much as we should think about the cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book , which means , &quot; what &apos;s the <unk> <unk> kansas ? &quot;
so we have to ask why .
but nevertheless , you don &apos;t interact much with people who don &apos;t be the way you are .
so we can think of things like the <unk> .
i &apos;m joking , but only half when i say you will not believe in the hospital if you get to a catholic &apos;s party without previous <unk> , warm and <unk> <unk> .
then bell is to his students .
within a few years , in the late 19th and early 20th century , the doctor suddenly resolved a diagnosis of diagnosis , the <unk> .
between the perception of the patient and the doctors in terms of the best care care , we have a real conflict .
another experience that i did in texas , before i went to stanford , influenced me .
the bad news : the good news is that we don &apos;t know . you see ? you can do that , we can do that .
i remember so much huge , <unk> , functional eyes that that ritual to me .
some of us call us <unk> , a more <unk> term .
in this case , we &apos;ve done this .
and for you back , here says , &quot; then a miracle .
and there was no one to <unk> .
religious <unk> .
more difficult is to move the dead to an answer .
my friend simon singh , a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , wrote the book &quot; the big bang , &quot; etc .
and now you open your eyes .
you can completely open it open , and it &apos;s <unk> .
but it really struck me that these guys , at least most of , know what they do for a living .
we all thought that was impossible .
you can create lots of change . you can make roads .
and this is something that people want to be done by all .
you don &apos;t need everyone .
hugo <unk> has not invented the <unk> <unk> and middle class in venezuela . he only did it .
and so it goes on .
they connect people together .
the reason ? modern medicine is now using a <unk> old method .
there &apos;s another catch .
this makes him more <unk> times faster , over a thousand times cheaper , and more than than our current <unk> for pancreatic cancer .
my experiences with the islamic world are quite different .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> that are happening .
and why is sex to babies , and why is babies in relationships a erotic disaster ?
because the secret of the leaders is .
and specifically , what &apos;s important about this description of the other or my own -- that &apos;s the same thing -- is interesting is that there &apos;s no <unk> in desire .
this is their <unk> and <unk> , which is biology , natural instinct .
and then the desire begins . this is how curiosity takes curiosity , <unk> .
you know there &apos;s a <unk> space that everyone is hearing .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a <unk> cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
that &apos;s usually played in smaller rooms .
so early <unk> , some places are <unk> .
so i thought , ok , is this a model for design , these intuitions that we do ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me and said , &quot; that &apos;s on me !
how do we solve the three problems that i want to bring to language here ?
albert einstein -- i was just in my with someone when i gave a talk in princeton , and i met mr. einstein .
what is the life ? why am i here ?
i never read a talk or a lecture or lecture .
and there were about 300 people .
he was talking about his personal experience .
a french historian said two centuries later , &quot; rarely have such a powerful spirit with so big humility to the authority of jesus christ . &quot;
or he was what he argued .
i &apos;m not going to use the <unk> nor the <unk> .
but you have to sit around 10 minutes and take a woman in the arm that isn &apos;t there .
i never was in .
harvest it .
with tears in my eyes , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
2010 : a young woman stands from president <unk> and says , her and her siblings , her parents died in war .
we go to rural areas and everything we do , what we do in this room , we create a space .
i failed .
so i want to look back at 20 years now and see that there &apos;s a <unk> girl , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> girl on this stage .
lg : like to .
licklider realized , computers can do the necessary necessary to make insights and decisions .
every interaction is recorded by more sensors : your phone , your credit card , your computer . it &apos;s a lot of data , and we get a chance to understand our way closer .
these records were human <unk> .
by being piloted a <unk> process , which is a task for 40 people over three months became a simple task for three people in 40 hours . all of these are <unk> of the <unk> .
we should stop seeing outside .
for dinner with my wife and the children , they &apos;re driving .
because people say , &quot; shit man , i don &apos;t have time to be fit ; you want to fit .
she became a much larger dog than i thought .
these impact affect all of us .
the boom of the national <unk> <unk> system itself to our problems .
think of <unk> , <unk> .
in the era after katrina , we have more common .
and you &apos;ve probably all done that , and if you don &apos;t , you &apos;ll have to .
help me make green black , help me make sustainability sexy .
so i thought this would be an opportunity to use scratch to make an interactive map for my mother .
but i &apos;m skeptical about what this <unk> is .
in this case , you take a <unk> , and you put it on a pile and the pile of <unk> , you control the behavior of the different characters in a game or a story , in this case , the big fish fish .
if you learn to code , you can program to learn .
when kids like training how to build these projects like this , they learn important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today is to give you a background , is that cars are art .
i want to talk to you .
and i think that idea that great cars are a soul , very useful . you all know that . you recognize a car with a soul with the first sight . you know how powerful it is .
this is one of my favorite stories that really describes our relationship to cars .
right ? and they decided that it would be cheaper , instead of a studio and six or seven , <unk> <unk> <unk> house in malibu .
there was a lot of dialogue .
i think we felt very close to each other that day , we broke up with strings , and we <unk> the concept for real nature and real creativity .
we didn &apos;t bring him to boston .
and i &apos;ve got a little lab .
now , we &apos;ve been trying to do clinical trials in four <unk> of this disease .
we don &apos;t have a team of <unk> and <unk> that can hold us on the market .
100 billion is the only number you have to know .
what you need to remember is we &apos;ve got to do with a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , with a hundred billion stars .
and he didn &apos;t explain why entropy was ever low .
unlike the low entropy of the universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to it , we have a good theory that can explain that if this theory is true , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and therefore , although the universe lasts forever , and ordinary matter and radiation will be <unk> , a certain amount of radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in the empty space .
but we also give huge fluctuations .
it cools down .
it &apos;s a <unk> fact of the universe that you &apos;re not supposed to accept and not question .
i had never used a computer yet .
it was a future i couldn &apos;t accept .
now , i want to share something to all of those out there , like me , to the africans and the poor who struggle with their dreams .
i don &apos;t matter what movement i made in my real world , just using my little device in the digital world , eight years ago , in 2000 , and in 2000 .
i took this very literally , i took my <unk> , and i put it a little <unk> , which the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the camera is actually understanding the only my motions , but also is able to understand what things i think in my hand .
and why only <unk> ? we can just play with the frames .
all the work you &apos;ve seen is about my learning in india .
this is juan carlos , king of spain .
this is going to be the third park in rio , june .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig deep underground underground to build a <unk> .
let me give you a quick example here .
almost every year , we have these terrible <unk> .
we are under average in terms of the <unk> in the city .
a city of the future is a city that &apos;s not going to cut out of this great community that is cities .
the best answer is to try to reconstruct a darwinian <unk> of our artistic and aesthetic preferences .
so the trick of evolution is to make them beautiful , so that they <unk> a kind of attraction so that they &apos;re joy to you , just look at them .
and some are in any case too big to use it for butchering .
our strong response to images , to the expression of emotions in art , to the beauty of music before the night sky , will be in us and our offspring , as long as human race exists .
well , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see how the computer sees the environment , and since you can &apos;t see the neurons , we actually actually <unk> the driver with red leds so that can really see what &apos;s going on .
let &apos;s see if mark can avoid .
or for blind people , everyday devices in the household , education and office .
a subtle <unk> had begun , the <unk> that ordinary people don &apos;t hear voices , and i heard them , meant that something could not be with me .
my mental <unk> was a catalyst for <unk> , dick and physical and sexual <unk> , and i was told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , you &apos;d be better at cancer because cancer is easier to cure , as schizophrenia . &quot;
to <unk> <unk> , when the social change begins , it can &apos;t be <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing now .
so what i &apos;m suggesting is that it &apos;s where we should look for life , rather than mars , although mars is also a much more nuanced and interesting place .
and the usual astronomers were full of contempt .
because it can be the kind of life that can live out there , it has tremendous benefits compared to life on a planet .
there was another object , this very high piece of furniture with creatures and <unk> and toothbrush -- quite <unk> things for a little kid .
the first projects were modest , but they were taking technology and maybe they could into things that people would use in a new way and maybe find a new functionality .
the other thing that <unk> is about <unk> is that we decided to take all the gadgets together , this whole <unk> , and try to make it as beautiful as possible .
so we called it a y water . so this is another example where everything happens in one room , and the three-dimensional design , the ideas , the ideas , the brand , it &apos;s all closely related to each other .
this is my <unk> anthony , switzerland , he had the laptop for a afternoon , i had to do it again . it was hard .

you need to negotiate .
it &apos;s the people from my generation growing up in a world where everything is <unk> and where some of our best talks have been on a screen .
finally , it could mean that you could print your own medicine .
and if you &apos;re telling you why it &apos;s even interesting , you have to look at the rest of saudi arabia , because it &apos;s a country that is divided between the <unk> .
maybe some things are bad traditions , and they need changes .
let me give you an example : in turkey , where i come from , which is a very <unk> republic , we had something that i call <unk> , which should protect the universities against <unk> students .
now if i was the only person who thinks that way , we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , when muslims have seen europe as a example , they were independent , <unk> .
so this is why the european process was to join the efforts of turkey , who joined the e.u. within turkey from the pious muslims while some <unk> nations were against it .
there &apos;s a very big nose that doesn &apos;t appear to be like it &apos;s related to anything .
if scientists today , a century later , they want to make neurons visible , then let them light up from inside , rather than making them .

but for many parts of africa , it was a colleague of mine , &quot; the department of the tuesday morning was just <unk> at the right time , so that the genocide could start at the <unk> . &quot;

td : lakshmi was working incredibly hard , even for my invitation , let alone all the rest of the rest of what it was doing , and i was sometimes pretty resistant , and i was also very nervous during this week .
and these two examples we &apos;ve seen machines that have learned in the simulation , and others who have learned it in reality .
when i say &quot; we , &quot; i mean the advice for <unk> .
but nobody believes it &apos;s actually going to be very effective if there is a real outbreak .
the biggest part of the price in the bush administration is actually more connected with anthrax and the threat by <unk> .
we know that the virus is going to mutate . it will be another virus .
but in the academic community there is a debate debate about what percentage of the race between people through <unk> and coughing and what &apos;s happening on the hands .
some of the poorer countries that most experienced with h5n1 have full of drugs that are already gone .
and i think even our leaders would say in this case , we &apos;re much more .
and i &apos;m very pleased to ask your questions .
our centers for <unk> have one of these developed tests -- as a <unk> <unk> .
and in the early days of people , they were similar bacterial infections , also no problem .
not only do you pay attention to how much fun you have , but also how the way that your <unk> is completely changing the way of designing san francisco .
please join me with a <unk> .
i was with a young juggler from a force , and he <unk> to sell me three clubs .
i was playing with <unk> and climbing , and i was getting a <unk> , and i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going to be a <unk> .
manhattan is not falling into infinity .
so i &apos;m not supposed to be here , right ?
i stay in the middle .
she was one , pushed me to the triumph .
because of the <unk> petals and branches , it &apos;s very dark in the <unk> , very quietly .
i and my colleagues of the <unk> are interested in the dynamics of the <unk> that live in the forest .
we &apos;re advising the media about <unk> ; we have a <unk> ; we have <unk> .
and then the students came into our <unk> , and they took their own <unk> with their own beats .
and our new project is that the inmates and we learn to grow the frog <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> of endangered <unk> in the states of washington and oregon .
he said , &quot; look what you hid before you . &quot;
therefore , we see a rising demand for <unk> , and therefore , therefore .
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
you have to believe me . trust me . &quot;
that day , i learned two really important things .
the deeper we go under water , the higher the pressure .
so i started this this about 15 years ago .
when the air gets out , air goes into the air floor , the air comes out of the air .
any of these computers can do the entire system , so if two of them are <unk> , there &apos;s reserves .
but this is what it looks like , and this habitat is still continuing to go over and over and over miles .
so sharks are not as dangerous as most people are .
when we found it , we were not even sure about the family he heard , so we called him <unk> , because he looked like it was coming out of one of his books .
the oxygen is a <unk> and it <unk> .
this means that each one and each of you knows at least a child who suffers from a <unk> disorder .
and his communication and social interactions improved so repetitive that he could visit a normal school , and even a <unk> .
it &apos;s kind of like life : if you &apos;re just in it , you can &apos;t pan out .
i know you &apos;ve never heard of him . but remember this day , you will hear from him , because he &apos;s an amazing man . &quot;
nk : no , he &apos;s died 25 years ago .
he had a lot of love about every lot of love , he loved everybody .
we , all of us , are what happens if a <unk> of hydrogen and helium is so long that it &apos;s starting to wonder about their origins .
this <unk> prove that life can exist in many other environments .
so you have to measure the diversity and the incredible scale of life on this planet at the first step , learn deeply to a contact with life elsewhere in all .
it &apos;s going to be as important as aluminum , and we will going to be able to extend it by growing on 350 antennae so it &apos;s sensitive and to offset the moore &apos;s law law .
and then we &apos;d like to make the <unk> search for human human survival .
many say it &apos;s the best place in the world to study the development of climate change .
each cylinder is a <unk> of time .
as you &apos;re with the ice , you put a extra pair of gloves in a oven so that you can attract a new pair of gloves and your fingers are stiff and stiff .
i believe in this place , a little bit of <unk> .
and our soldiers are not just paying to <unk> pipelines in <unk> vigil when they actually got involved in service to <unk> american bombing .
you can carry this further , and efficiency almost <unk> with some more <unk> improvements and the rise of the big <unk> .
we could build larger cars , which would contribute security , but slightly should be .
but instead they sell it to china and japan , because we have our <unk> for protecting our <unk> and not .
and that is , by measuring the <unk> of these kinds of materials , or in this case , making <unk> <unk> , as good <unk> ; the <unk> can do this as well as it did the the internet <unk> .
it can &apos;t act a a huge <unk> conspiracy .
there were two types of negative feedback that we received .
let &apos;s hope it &apos;s really stable .
oops , i &apos;m wrong .
he ended up with a <unk> , a dutch <unk> named kamal van meegeren , who sold a wonderful vermeer to give him a prize that &apos;s about 10 million dollars today .
he he he said , he looked like he first discovered that there was bad in the world .
&quot; it depends on it . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but how attractive you find them how much they move them or they move on the , depends on what they think they &apos;re looking at .
but each of these three objects has a value beyond what it takes you , because of its story .
but i don &apos;t want to copy a copy , even if i can &apos;t see the difference .
so he brought joshua bell to take his <unk> in a subway station in washington d.c. , to to a corner and see how much money he would take .
the second shock hurts less because you &apos;re used to a bit bit of it .
and if you &apos;re <unk> , you can see that there might be some kind of political <unk> .
they <unk> that they &apos;re a <unk> , <unk> member of the american <unk> of <unk> , which sounds very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is , of course , is that people who eat vegetables and olive olive oil , fewer <unk> .
the <unk> is one of the most intriguing things in the whole world of medicine .
it &apos;s a <unk> end , if you &apos;re a drug in such a high dose , that there &apos;s more side effects , and your new drug will look better .
the great trials are closer to the real answer .
that &apos;s a problem that there &apos;s no answer to this .
and very soon , they would have started , this coal <unk> , <unk> by <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , back to china and all over the world .
can you imagine how you would feel if you were in my place ?
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know that , all know this .
there &apos;s this thing , the world &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s right from the middle of the united states .
and what do you see ? they are christians .
man , the americans , are kind of like , &quot; ah , <unk> .
these christians are <unk> .
they generalize . that &apos;s wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and everyone else is chinese .
can you imagine that maybe one of you woke up in the morning and it &apos;s going to be up and said , &quot; honey , i &apos;m back .
everything has changed .
and all of that has enormous implications in the world .
i think thomas jefferson has done this very well in words .
so for the <unk> in the audience , the reason that <unk> have a bigger budget is a <unk> , because it &apos;s because <unk> are easier to connect into other languages and cultures , so the market is larger for these films .
but it will happen within this century .
this is not the <unk> of the u.s. , which is going to be over a million , but the gdp of the world per capita -- 200,000 dollars .
also , as everyone here knows -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is the peak of an life of life that began with the rise on the gulf coast at the <unk> .
a lot of our actions on the planet that are reflected on our living environment are just by faith and guess .
each has been one for thousands of years .
we have to calm down before we ruin the planet .
e.o. wilson : the life on earth
another <unk> is the famous european <unk> .
the passenger pigeon genome contains 1.3 billion base pairs .
the de-extinction of de-extinction falls into this category .
real falcons made of light <unk> .
so there &apos;s a program that &apos;s a program that &apos;s just brilliant .
this is an emotional theme . some people are up .
my grandmother was a housewife .
i also made my own comics , and it was another way of telling stories , through words and through images .
and we were sitting there , and we were in silence , and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
don &apos;t use your own style . draw not draw how you tell you .
&quot; rather <unk> , i have your <unk> .
i also also read a book book book called &quot; <unk> police <unk> : the <unk> who <unk> . &quot;
sound affects us continually , psychologically , cognitively and <unk> .
this is a 32 million pounds of <unk> <unk> , which was recently built in england recently designed by an british <unk> .
but it &apos;s not just kids who are affected by this .
people who say , don &apos;t sit next to this team , because the noise like that and the other needs .
&quot; upwake &quot; tells a story about zero , a contemporary man who who <unk> his life in the suitcase , and the gap of dream and reality and not able to <unk> both .
<unk> <unk> and four and a half and the , what was what was a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> talented actors .
i know theater connects us to .
now the time we can use the diversity of our talents to create a intelligent , more relevant , more extraordinary , and the .
if you look at the bathroom , you &apos;ll see some products more products , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but also toothpaste .
<unk> collagen -- or since the 1970s , collagen , has been used by pigs -- to fold it into folding .
and in total , i found 185 products .
and i said , &quot; my love , i fear you have a long and <unk> year before you . &quot;
i told them , you should say that in front of you , &quot; i &apos;m somebody .
they were given me to be somebody , in a time when nobody felt like nobody .
they &apos;re working on the ninth of the ninth , so she started in 1930 and now reached the letter of the letter .
hundreds of verbs can behave like this .
you can think of it as the language of thoughts , or <unk> .
so the mystery is , why , jay requests , <unk> , and <unk> , often being covered ?
you can try to imagine what would be if language could only be used literally literally .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have a problem with that .
here &apos;s my argument . is it worth of ? is it good ?
it &apos;s it . it &apos;s <unk> .
what kind of insight would you get to convince me ?
all of these different roles . can you imagine an argument that you participate in , but in the audience , and you &apos;re watching in the debate ?
or -- and this is the most salient part for me : we want them to put us in the world of nature . we bring a <unk> and find the masters of the adaptation that can inspire us .
it changed everything . there were no longer <unk> on the boat .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the <unk> national laboratory .
this would be <unk> for fuel cells if you could do without <unk> .
it &apos;s not easy , because life is only a subset of elements in the <unk> .
feeling and react : feedback is very important .
what you don &apos;t see , you can &apos;t count .
my first business was a <unk> . i started in the taliban .
in south and indonesia , almost a million companies are women .
because , as the <unk> gene , you &apos;re going to be smaller <unk> in direct terms of <unk> economic <unk> .
and the in all around the world are not exceptions .
people would <unk> if this <unk> and this acronym .
i have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> cows on my <unk> , and i want to use paper paper now to make it happen .
we first got it .
what does that mean ?
when i started to engage with them , i realized they were incredibly good adapted .
but researchers had a problem .
until finally , they graduated from and the campus -- and sure happy to come there -- some of the time later , and discovered that crows were still <unk> to them .
we &apos;ve found that they &apos;re really smart and they can teach each other to each other .
for example , , would come back , look for the peanut , go back .
but there were three problems , three puzzles i couldn &apos;t solve , and i want to talk about that , but more importantly , i found a <unk> .
who would ever hire me ? &quot;
and imagine what might happen , because every region has offer something .
let me make the connection .
you know , there &apos;s the future of the future there , you have to understand it .
that &apos;s a lot to <unk> .
oh yeah , i &apos;m going to be the johnny <unk> of the notes .
there &apos;s about 10 million <unk> .
and over here we see , with the immortal of the radiologists israel israel , &quot; like the hand , the penis , in a way that reminds of <unk> . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes , but i &apos;d rather be eating if you didn &apos;t have anything to it . &quot;
and i said , &quot; you should make an experiment .
he had one line in his book that came out of the <unk> , and there was a <unk> maria <unk> who had trouble with the answer with the gun .
so now you have a evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i have to read you what she said , because i find it so beautiful .
i find that very unfortunate . not because i would have been able to use it . i wanted to see him .
and this is actually the beginning of our story .
now , i would have thought that at the age of 50 , one of the skills that i really had was to bind my shoes .
i have to tell you that i &apos;m not here .
yeah . the artist doesn &apos;t seem to know so to know where to put the different colors .
but i can see in your faces , still , that they &apos;re a little skeptical skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and i think it &apos;s appropriate .
after a while , i decided to have a little fun , and before i left the room in the morning , i took some things in the room .
and now they &apos;re all in here .
my father was an , so my adolescence was really interesting .
the song as a mere fact .
i &apos;m going to say , &quot; wait a minute , i &apos;m going to do the wheels . &quot; from pure protest , i bought the <unk> wheels , and i built them up and -- -- can i check my <unk> ?
it sounds simple , but i think we &apos;re generally in our society and culture with the <unk> .
he had designed the <unk> himself , and he was really proud of it .
man , i love the thing .
the follow of a planet on which already seven billion people live .
and very proud of the <unk> seat , he was the <unk> seat that he had his <unk> his <unk> , and he was looking for the fine <unk> around the seat .
intent -- a life with intent -- is living on the original a little bit better .
i saw the healthy mass of a left <unk> , and i was that she was lost , <unk> all of what i hadn &apos;t yet done yet , but couldn &apos;t do it anymore .
and i began to think of how many times before that would have been my life if that man wouldn &apos;t hurt me if my genes had a different portion of experience .
i was , but i was now despite a <unk> myself , and i guess i guess i made myself .
i had a little bit simpler to just <unk> this turkish <unk> against four words and to make myself on my way .
he spent six months in prison , lost his <unk> for a decade .
yes , contrast .
we &apos;re working with the machine with <unk> laboratory at the university of california , san diego .
first , the perception of people , and second , a natural interface , a natural form of copying , so that interaction with the robot is intuitive to them .
and yet , i made this idea .
after i realized this economic threat , i thought we needed to find a solution to this problem .
some people actually put off the speakers , like talking about nathan <unk> &apos;s way , or the one of tim ferriss , likes to be viewed as a .
i don &apos;t know a tedtalk that includes this .
this time i paid 25 cents , because i thought that was a little harder .
and yet , there was one thing that all of us were sure about : expansion had to slow down .
keep the mystery of the dark energy in your mind , because i &apos;m going to call you three main of string theory to string theory .
the <unk> rate went to about 10 to 500 .
and he was working decades of explaining this number , but he didn &apos;t have a success , and we know why .
each of these universes has extra dimensions .
because the astronomers of today , turning powerful telescopes to the sky , a handful of <unk> photons -- a kind of <unk> <unk> , , billion years on the road .
well , i want to be honest with you , and tell you that most of it is just a trick , but a trick that actually works .
remember , it &apos;s the first time you meet it . we want to make it really compelling and really interesting .
he said , &quot; go , milo . squash it . &quot;
pm : so this is dimitri &apos;s right in <unk> .
we don &apos;t know anybody here .
the next moment , the phone doesn &apos;t work anymore , the television is running , men are <unk> in the street .
it was a very grim meeting of reporters who worked in war , the staff of aid aid , and of course , the courageous , brave people of sarajevo themselves .
when i &apos;m going to ask why i &apos;m going to make why i keep going to leave why i &apos;m going to leave that , that &apos;s the reason .
but it &apos;s my profession of this testimony , and this is the <unk> , the core of the thing , for reporters .
even before a goal appears to you with the joystick , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the target , no matter where it is .
basically , we <unk> the animals , so they learned to to control these <unk> and to explore objects in the virtual world .
so in an experiment we did a few years ago , we went to the limit .
so let &apos;s start in china .
so dai manju did the <unk> .
please raise your hand .
the last reason it &apos;s done with is that women are part of the solution , not the problem .
in niger , one of seven women dies in the average of a child .
it became part of the solution , not the problem .
larry <unk> , when he was a <unk> of the world bank , once said , &quot; it can be good that investment investing in girls in the developing world is the highest <unk> . &quot;
this is bill <unk> &apos;s book .
and that was the feather of a bird .
this whole <unk> around one of our <unk> tells us that there is a <unk> .
and even this image is the suspects of being <unk> -- like something from the <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> circus .
one of those ways was that we could have drawn into small stores .
they put their arrowheads and they say , &quot; i want to exchange this arrowheads against finished arrows . we &apos;ll share 50 to 50 . &quot;
there are places in this island where they can meet three or four miles on a new language .
so if 27 individuals join each other in the table , their 23 languages evaporate , they &apos;ll tell you a simple one , they need an army of <unk> <unk> to be prepared for all the <unk> possibilities .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that it &apos;s also about language .
and what &apos;m most interested in is the invisible space between a text and the <unk> image , and how the image is changed through the text , and the text through the image .
these are <unk> <unk> , walking across the bottom of the atlantic ocean and connecting north america with europe .
they &apos;re the negative .
but through the sense of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> can change the <unk> .
larry <unk> was eight years of a half of a <unk> <unk> , in arizona , for kidnapping and <unk> <unk> of a <unk> boy on a <unk> .
and that &apos;s where people are left .
and they brought them to to texas here for us here .
and now they &apos;re driving with the <unk> where it is in that moment .
it &apos;s just the vastness of space that makes it look like this , not .
this is what you call a <unk> feeling , the pursuit of happiness and human design .
part of it is the legacy of <unk> , the <unk> , which was the pursuit of happiness for <unk> , it was driven by <unk> aspects of the individual , and could not be found in reality .
a <unk> in science of happiness is that happiness and performance is not a <unk> of <unk> in a closed-loop continuum .
it starts in the <unk> .
here &apos;s a three-year-old baby .
in the animal kingdom , there &apos;s only one way to increase status , that &apos;s dominance .
i want to close with some quotes .
why should you choose rats ?
once the rat has understood that , we make the task a little bit .
you can actually cure t.b. , even in people who are hiv-positive .
knowing that a patient who &apos;s <unk> <unk> , to 15 people -- 15 healthy people -- a year , can be sure that we &apos;ve already saved a lot of lives .
here we see neurons .
so the important for imitation and <unk> is important .
now , the question is : if i just watch a different person , why am i not confused , and literally , i &apos;ve just watching this <unk> of naked , as someone will touched ?
thank you . i have two missions here today .
i &apos;m not about the <unk> , it &apos;s not about the pollen itself .
all these pictures were taken by a <unk> by by the way in the lab of kew <unk> .
even each one of us has a story to tell the <unk> of us .
we need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign to address this crisis .
right at the same time , in the 1980s , when we were growing and dying and death , it would write a editorial for the new england journal of medicine , called the <unk> .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike <unk> , x-ray , <unk> , women , their <unk> for women , their skin <unk> the heart of the heart every time we &apos;re building something that &apos;s also a little bit of radiation , we ask , &quot; is this test really necessary ? &quot;
okay , so here we started .
they did what they said , they kept <unk> and they were pushed .
the cells have something like bermuda ; in the dish they don &apos;t feel the native .
what does that mean for us ?
we spent eight to 10 hours every day , and we raised eight hours a half hours of <unk> and <unk> .
this is one of the first acquisitions that came out of a year ago , which is really surprised us .
and finally , my son alone is in a <unk> .
three of the most important people in this project philip <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> roy are here to see here .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic in play .
this is the first time our son made more than two steps in a row in the movie .
and that &apos;s a important question to ask , because the better we understand how brains do meaning , the better we can communicate , and i think , also , the better we can think and work .
it &apos;s kind of a center where you see a picture and you think , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional response to the mechanism . &quot;
what we &apos;re literally doing is to paint our teams , paint the whole thing on a big wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just about hygiene , it &apos;s also about the possibility of relaxation .
so don &apos;t build it .
if you put that into the building , if you have a <unk> and a window , we say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s the way broken , it must be repaired .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we kept on .
are we just dumb ?
you can can it for two years , if you read eight hours a day .
so in order to <unk> and say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police are waiting for the rescue of firemen to cut the vehicle into pieces , to get the body &apos;s body .
and that &apos;s enough to the present in the united states , where a eye of divinity is found .
so all of this leads us to -- <unk> , just to name this to the thing : what we most do is use digital devices .
this is the implication of the destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right side of the stroke .
this is a very , very low level of getting out of the health care system .
he then held my jaw in the right position while he <unk> my teeth .
alfred mann is an brilliant physicist and innovator who &apos;s fascinated to close the classroom in mind , whether he &apos;s a deaf man , or a blind man , or a blind man , or a <unk> .
now , i had to figure out what was going on in the dark years , figure out what was going on when everything that was doing today .
and it works . it works .
<unk> : so if you have the opportunity , you spend time with simon .
and these were the developing world : they had big families and a relatively short life .
and they &apos;re on this side . there &apos;s a big <unk> of africa and the one .
and then deng xiaoping came to get money to china , and they brought the country back to a spot .
a search of search , which we can copy the data into a more complex format and publish it worldwide , and what do we hear when we look at it ?
but this creates hypotheses .
you know , darwin explains life after it was born , what was the essence of life ?
and i learned francis crick , i know .
but there were plenty of literature in literature .
we were not the best chemists in the room .
i was chosen to be unhappy ; my girl didn &apos;t married me .
you can actually compare dna to the normal of the regular and <unk> bars .
and so i &apos;ll just leave you by telling you that we have 20 people at schizophrenia .
average average , the defense costs in such a case two million dollars and takes 18 months when they win .
first , don &apos;t fight at the patent , but against the <unk> .
my solution : give me this patent , and i &apos;ll let you disappear with <unk> .
&quot; why not ? &quot; the girls were .
the fathers were in one place where they moved their daughters to play , their chairs and their hand could come to the dance .
that &apos;s a great technology .
there &apos;s not a lot left left in the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in people .
can &apos;t see the enemy for most of the time , and we needed to have a different approach to eradicate polio than we had with smallpox .
it helped to control pandemic financial production , for example .
the reality of polio today is something very different .
and yet , the impossible is .
bill gates : now bruce , where are you going to find the most difficult places ?
bruce <unk> : how we will eradicate polio
dj : so we found this <unk> now in all sorts of different animals , especially in the cats .
and to our surprise , it was a <unk> .
for us , this elephant has become a symbol in inspiration in many ways , a symbol of this hope that we do at our work .
it was incredibly amazing than she took it in safety to protect it from the hyena .
and of course , if i look at these <unk> that became <unk> , they reminds me of a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic because their fate is in our hand .
we need it . we need respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman as a community and as part of the planet , and we need to keep on it .
after all , it seems obvious that the earth is large and <unk> , the sun is small and <unk> , but it &apos;s worth remembering what <unk> is going to do .
and that &apos;s because of the middle of the heat is always there .
nature &apos;s nature depends on what kind of animal we are .
because there &apos;s so many of it , and because between you no consensus between you can &apos;t have a <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , the way we see it in middle middle , and and solid .
people as a machines may be scientifically and <unk> , but it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , if you want to guess what the next person will do next .
over night , i was appointed to <unk> <unk> at the age of 40 .
and then one cursor , which i control with my head , allows me to see video clips from the robot and send orders to the robot by putting buttons in a <unk> .
with the help of people like you , we can make this dream .
for example , in oceanography , a <unk> lexicon is designed by <unk> by basically the <unk> that the dolphins , the dolphins .
i think together we can form a global community together .
this is a hot <unk> <unk> .
there are some -- there are some lessons that you can learn from from .
but usually we don &apos;t do that .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
it &apos;s down to 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem we need to solve .
i also take that most of you don &apos;t speak chinese -- which is really sad when you think that &apos;s the most common language on the internet .
what do you look at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this picture , maybe you think , &quot; why should that be interest in all ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find the world in it .
they would bring wealth and security , religious violence and make sure that states never <unk> terrorists .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is that ?
i love this dish .
and the war , the 20 million people killed life -- until today the civil war civil war .
<unk> sen , who is this guy , &quot; i would have made all this money , but i spent all of time trying to find the american man who had stolen my prescription .
chinese restaurants did the same thing , mostly the same thing , would argue , with the <unk> and the <unk> -- even the restaurant -- but without a centralized name .
in contrast , we have general tso chicken chicken that began in in new york city in the early 1970s , i was just starting at university in new york city in the early 1970s , so ...
so what we see in the 17th century , 18th century , is the <unk> search for medicine from <unk> , making the same thing .
so people would have a really big <unk> .
when the <unk> began to become less , i became more and more inclusive , until i thought my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
do you remember having a child on every line ?
at 18 and 19 , i ended up crying through the night .
again , i &apos;m going to get a little depressed and a little bit <unk> .
so , many of us , we know , there are a lot of us to do in the building of a better world .
he goes around , &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know . where did the world work work on the known problems that came out of the potential of earthquakes and climate change ?
if you make the impossible , you can do it .
but we have reached an agreement to climate change .
and there was god crying .
the <unk> is something remarkable : they use two ingredients , proteins and water that are in their settings to create a material that is known as an extraordinary thing , comparable to technical fibers like kevlar .
or you can make beautiful things like this , if the camera can capture this .
here you see it &apos;s going to be taken by the tissue .
so with my new project , marilyn <unk> , i want to use art to create technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that says the <unk> and the <unk> -- hopefully none -- hopefully not -- to help him meet some of his next decisions .
what do i want to do ? &quot;
in the frame of this unprecedented demonstration , heather knight <unk> , is a <unk> , which is far more than <unk> -- he collects the feedback of his audience and the <unk> of his audience , and he does the answer to the ?
stanley milgram , inventor of the known <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> that there were only two people a connection between only five to seven steps .
how does our view of relations with very rich groups ?
there was a contest that i was going to tell you , and where perhaps he could have had this epiphany to the ear .
um ... my dad , a <unk> ?
it was his father who decided that they needed false papers .
the sense of responsibility about other people , despite his young age of 17 , and also his fault , being a <unk> , because he was out of a camp while he was out of a camp while he was staying his friends , he kept his whole life .
and as my favorite and my <unk> believed , some of the things were , my father was wrong papers .
i asked him , given the victim that he had had , he had ever <unk> that .
we grow from a few million people to the seven billion people we are today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a <unk> <unk> , at <unk> level , which is a <unk> after the nearest <unk> , which seems to be in a good state .
if you put the forests , the boundary , the boundary , you get the capacity of being stable , you &apos;re going to be stable .
with the realization of <unk> , grapes , the most great <unk> reef reef <unk> and scientists , that the great barrier reef of coral is actually a <unk> of the current <unk> .
but the drama is , of course , is that clear change is not a option .
so that brings me to another reason why i &apos;m here today : because i really like media of all the things .
this is a <unk> of a race from a developed developed .
first , he &apos;s using a ancient species of manufacturing , <unk> and connected this with a three-dimensional perspective , which was a whole new technique at that time .
and using the injection of sugar on black <unk> , i hired portraits of them .
it became very big images , and i took them with a very large camera , a <unk> camera .
my interest in <unk> , especially in bad <unk> , is very far .
on the back is a sequence that &apos;s also in the chimpanzee .
so we can ask , is there some general differences between africans and <unk> ?
and then you can compare it to the genome of living people today .
so we can then look for the same questions , like neanderthals : do they mix with ancestors in the world of people ?
there are a lot of people who designed their own vision , like this vision of the beginning of the 20th century .
and after my belief , the plane of the future has its own consciousness .
imagine , imagine , growing in the 3d printer , and are embedded in a <unk> , and follow the forces that occur in their components .
they didn &apos;t talk , but especially they were extraordinary isolated from the world around them , from their environment and from the people .
they would <unk> . they would call the police .
now , we know it &apos;s about one of 100 .
you see a video .
you feel that the research that you &apos;ve been working on , you can really have an effect on reality , that actually can prevent these experiences that i had started my way in this field .
then you start off .
you can <unk> you in a rigid -- chin on the <unk> , arms extended across your <unk> .
they made everything like we taught them .
and after the battle , they bring this <unk> exhibition and they do what you call &quot; <unk> , to teach you what you &apos;ve done wrong .
people also changed .
i said , &quot; where &apos;s he ? &quot;
it &apos;s not a matter of content .
and she pointed on the left piece to tell me how problematic this picture was , that it was represented for you with the idea of what black was represented .
it &apos;s really in this sense of realizing that i have a new set of questions i &apos;ve got .
well , that &apos;s kind of an obvious statement up there .
and the kids said , &quot; how shall we do this . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to multiply numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long did you do it before you decided you didn &apos;t understand anything ? &quot;
their <unk> <unk> to 50 , which is to new schools , and to get a <unk> biotechnology .
76 percent . the test , two months later , the result was 76 percent .
so after eight ted talks , he wanted to become a da da vinci .
that &apos;s <unk> .
suddenly , i looked out of the darkness on the <unk> side of the room , a <unk> of mirrors that were been <unk> from the moon .
if i had to reduce the whole story on a picture , what would it be ?
now i &apos;m going to show you some snippets from my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the tempest .
and our little life ends into a sleep .
bono : they &apos;re <unk> .
i know you understand that .
so blue , blue , everything became blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both of them in africa .
it &apos;s another one that acts on the interface of health and business .
let &apos;s use markets as the most efficient legal device that we have , and find out what price people would pay for it so that they would have the dignity .
thank you .
the <unk> was this : if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroyed two <unk> and 10 television .
so this little <unk> of turning out of its tracks , and it was a problem .
this is pretty good . it &apos;s slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of a couple of the models that i work with .
tissue from <unk> density and behavior is the second part , and that actually will be the key to use these models for self-reflection .
thank you .
and try to make it fly , like , was to shoot a arrow with the <unk> end , and it was hard work , and boy , boy , i learned a lot of respect to nature .
now let &apos;s look at the other side .
we &apos;re working on projects -- even <unk> designs , as <unk> as <unk> -- with darpa , the california institute of technology and university of los angeles .
be careful , just behave like wood or something .
now i wasn &apos;t trying to be a <unk> .
they go forever .
that &apos;s over two billion .
it takes him for three years to <unk> for his estimation .
don &apos;t forget that one &apos;s a <unk> .
but to me , that &apos;s great because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time that we live in , in the human mind and the machine together .
i have a mass . where do they come from ?
it &apos;s too afraid that the way that we could go from the way in 20 to 30 years .
all of evidence points that this is going to be from a virus .
i took the opportunity to take a couple samples from jonas &apos; tumor and a few samples from other body parts .
she took him to the veterinarian , and that discovered something <unk> .
finally , cancer is a <unk> consequence of the ability to share our cells and adapt to their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and this is a global phenomenon .
they would be <unk> to wait for it .
and that &apos;s the third reason why a low expectation doesn &apos;t make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t think that the numbers were going to go on .
first , i &apos;m going to show you the <unk> for optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion is not going to break when we &apos;re aware of this <unk> .
but what we &apos;ll see in the 21st century is asia , which is incremental , to back over half the world &apos;s population , and to do half the global economy .
you could think of this as the privatization of the <unk> .
after 1958 the soviets had sputnik , it said , &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you live in japan or new delhi or <unk> , or <unk> , you will be something different than if you &apos;re in beijing .
and if we have strategies in which we get this into larger historical context , we will be able to do this process .
how do we define our national interests so that it &apos;s not just a <unk> <unk> , positive sum ?
that &apos;s the conventional approach .
this typically has the responsibility to <unk> <unk> to guarantee a stable <unk> .
they &apos;re on the long term .
the jobs for who ? especially for young men .
after most of the time , the legal system is collapsed , you can &apos;t even get sympathy .
the provision would be from the conflict of <unk> , government .
this is the heart of my hometown of new orleans .
the military has understood it . they call the climate change , the security of stability , and stability , as governments in the world are arguing about how to react .
it allows you to be more productive so that you can afford insurance for time .
these are certainly inspiring examples of possible solutions if we feel able to plan to plan a <unk> world .
listen like chinese practice english by shouting it .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
and that includes things like the concrete world with <unk> <unk> , abstractions that we &apos;re trying to make logically , and we also take the hypothetical seriously , which we ask ourselves , what is what ?
luria looked people before they were entering the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to a threshold of the concrete world .
and says , &quot; the north pole there is always snow snow . &quot;
they chose <unk> instead of new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively demanding professions .
would you deserve to be killed ? &quot;
you could say , a half .
it feels like i landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they sat me in making a degree in something .
he &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris made it with personal sacrifice , this film .
i &apos;m one of your <unk> .
there &apos;s a prime minister , <unk> , <unk> and a <unk> , or president of the <unk> .
boy : &quot; the <unk> is serious .
we were all mad at them , &quot; why are you doing that ?
that &apos;s going to be much more true if you read it . &quot;
we had always played the game after school for weeks , about seven weeks , and we basically had all the <unk> crises in all .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
a lot of people were paying for jobs , and they joined the <unk> .
it &apos;s like its own small compound .
if i put all three legs on it , in the three peaks of the triangle , i would get a <unk> .
so all you &apos;re doing is -- it &apos;s a very smooth proposition -- this old <unk> and this old plastic , and this <unk> is very simple to go into an old <unk> .
that &apos;s possible if you have a whole piece of paper , <unk> paper -- you can be in a <unk> school or in a government school -- a leaf , a ruler and a pen , no glue , no scissors .
what we do is a very simple cost-benefit analysis .
this is a little straw , which you do is these two corners of here , it &apos;s like a <unk> .
here &apos;s two magnets .
there were a lot of passengers on the ship , and they were bored , so the captain bought her to his deck .
at the eg conference , <unk> <unk> shows simple and yet amazing plans to transform waste in really lifelike , walkable constructed toys that kids can build themselves -- while they learn basic principles of science and design .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology that was a lot of evidence .
and there are some examples of projects that are consciously trying to mimic ecosystems .
and with a little planning , we can get a place in traffic , which is open to open space , to open space for people , to bring people back to food and turn waste in opportunities in opportunities .
this photo was done by the day of the <unk> , and only a year later , it looked like this .
if you put seawater , the first thing that is <unk> is calcium carbonate .
no , you have to explore people &apos;s <unk> with visions of <unk> <unk> . &quot;
i was looking for somebody who &apos;s jewish because i &apos;m jewish , and because i &apos;m very important .
but the real thing was that there were a lot of men who wanted to go out with me .
very few of us have the ability to absolutely be absolutely honest with themselves .
he &apos;s like to travel while it &apos;s not on a <unk> .
i was basically trying to be like <unk> .
because remember , my favorite thing is : you have to reach a <unk> of 700 points , and nobody did .
most of them . <unk> are 33 years old , not eight years old , and if we look at the <unk> demographics of the , the <unk> of tomorrow &apos;s older adults .
imagine whose vision is very , very good .
these <unk> have even a lot of other benefits in terms of attention , and a aspect of attention that is clearly better to do , is our ability to track objects in our environment .
i want to ask you to remember this result , and to put it into the context of another group of <unk> , a group that actually is looking at in our society that is made of people who are doing business .
let me explain this step with a piece called mental rotation .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just just all kinds of programs that we &apos;re looking at .
so it was a big , very complex project that i wasn &apos;t even sure to do , whether it &apos;s all the way .
so wolfram alpha knows about many and many things .
on one hand , we have mathematica , with the kind of precise , <unk> language and a large network of <unk> developed capacity , capable of doing a lot of lines .
so with physical engineering , we &apos;re basically used to go to the world and realize that certain things are meaningful for certain technological purposes and so on .
a few years ago , i was quite excited to discovery that there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules that are successful in particular relativity , and also general relativity and gravity and at least evidence to the quantum mechanics .
sw : i think .
and at that time , i actually lost more relatives , and teachers who were <unk> me , hiv / aids .
they hop up . they wear red clothes .
since my mother was a woman , she had no right to estate and automatically , everything my family was , anyway , my father , so he was right .
and the day before the actual ceremony was we were excited , and we didn &apos;t slept all night .
he was a sneakers , and that in a village that didn &apos;t even have <unk> roads , it was very attractive .
i promised him to be a <unk> girl , i would come back and do everything they would ask me about .
if it became pregnant before the marriage was <unk> , the mother was made charge of it and punished .
as we speak , 125 girls will never be <unk> again .
consumers , represent 72 percent of american american annual , are actually beginning to pay attention to the same as banks and companies , to be <unk> , in their daily life , to free themselves from commitment and risks that are us when we move forward .
and what you &apos;re seeing here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we actually actually <unk> and essentially future future , the future children of our households .
<unk> are up by 48 percent , the cornell of stanford .
we also see a trend in a slightly more explicit . right ?
one of them is the <unk> of community and neighborhood , and more than a support of neighbors than support .
we also observe a big <unk> .
the trend for the <unk> is immense .
and then we take the phenomenon of <unk> .
and then i came to me , i &apos;m the only one who does this ?
you could exploit them .
this is what i do in my life -- stories write , novels , and i want to share with you now a couple of stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures , the <unk> .
our <unk> could be shrinking . our heart could be stunted , and our <unk> could be <unk> if we &apos;re too long within our cultural <unk> .
and i was the first time i i call it &quot; representative foreigner . &quot;
i &apos;m not a <unk> , no italian or <unk> . i &apos;m going to ask why i do that , but the commute between languages allows me to reinvent myself .
he wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story became a huge issue , because i was haunted by the .
literature has to lead us to the other side .
i could get a novel about an muslim woman , and maybe it &apos;ll be a happy story , and i write in my book , maybe , a <unk> , professor professor in norway .
so you go to the existing songs , you put it in little bits , put it in little bits , put it back together , and you get a new song , but this new song is clearly old songs .
instead , these laws and laws of the world are actually more likely to use the property .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;ll summarize what it touches . <unk> alarm : the <unk> of the telephone , by giving a symbol with your finger .
our creativity comes from the outside , not from the inside .
and they say , &quot; okay , but how do you recognize your address ? &quot;
but in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the newspaper newspaper .
what &apos;s beautiful is you can probably see this limb there , sort of a <unk> <unk> almost from the limb .
our exploration study our system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now , this led to a understanding of the nuclear structure , because it &apos;s going to be that atoms have a single core , with <unk> that circle around it .
this image shows a galaxy , a <unk> , , , , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think it can ultimately be the most compelling ideas for us , about our place in the universe and really the value of our planet .
this is here . this is at home . that &apos;s us .
and with every speaker and every touch of the screen , we &apos;re <unk> and <unk> <unk> of our personal information all over our way through digital woods .
when our daughter sat down at the <unk> , i asked her , &quot; is it going to put a lot of emphasis on musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t do that <unk> .
well , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i was so much and i i i decided to go to my 27th birthday that i would not talk about just a day -- a day .
and they &apos;re not talking ...
and i explained to help of a friend who understood my sign that i was john francis , that i was walking through the , that i was not talking , that this would be the last time somebody would translate my sign .
well , i <unk> my backpack again .
i started speaking , because i studied <unk> .
but the <unk> was that i thought of every birthday on my silence , but never made my decision to use just my feet .
born and grew up in north korea .
sometimes i also found small jobs in exchange against food .
i was constantly worried that i would be able to get back and back again .
i felt so powerless because in america i had so much food , but my father had died .
but i believe that your gesture of love and care can save the life of another joseph and transform thousands of other <unk> , who still have hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but this was a lot stronger than i expected to do and make a easy touch , and as a industrial engineer , also make it a <unk> .
but then i was very disappointed with my profession as an architect , because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but for privileged people , rich , government , contractor .
and then following year , in 1995 , there was a big earthquake in kobe in japan .
so i wonder , what is a <unk> and what a <unk> building ?
but this is really needed .
so we &apos;re learning some of the most important things in our lives before we are born , even in the womb .
so fetuses are even studying the particular language that &apos;s spoken in the world that they &apos;re born in .
there &apos;s a mixture of influences that are so individually individually and curious , like the woman itself .
why should malnutrition in utero in utero ?
you can also see <unk> , but you can see with other eyes .
this confidence in the <unk> is essential for any kind of <unk> .
the viewers are <unk> to <unk> , which are very logical , but not with the <unk> , what &apos;s going on in front of their eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , it might actually give us a smile .
you may remember that as the <unk> <unk> , okay , that time when the biggest deal of all time .
if you &apos;re a high animal at the unesco , and someone tells you , &quot; what is you actually doing for the eliminating of hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start a campaign campaign ?
this is actually a strategy , and i &apos;m not saying that strategy is a matter .
for me , all the music became .
now , when i use my software , the camera sees the <unk> , and it puts the place of the <unk> in relation to the <unk> , and you &apos;ve got a whiteboard .
i remember the poor needed something more <unk> -- eat , clothing , shelter -- what they didn &apos;t have .
i even felt a <unk> of shame .
now , since i heard him speak , i was excited for various reasons .
i was not even asked by a donation , which was usually my way .
it &apos;s about the <unk> of the poor , and it &apos;s about giving us a way of governing each other , which is that what would confirm , a partnership , not one of which is based on a traditional kind of donation , the math metaphor can happen .
it &apos;s a very powerful combination , a very strong combination .
now , the moment , <unk> is very at the beginning , and it &apos;s <unk> , for me , that it &apos;s just a vehicle , just a tool .
what &apos;s the future of humanity ?
now i &apos;m going to turn to the second big question : are we alone , or are there other life in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions , we &apos;ve made remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
look at this one .
here are photographs of myself .
even the rate of rate , every 18 months and every <unk> member of the <unk> knows , this is the most law .
but what about them ? what &apos;s going to do with them ?
they blew up in their villages over the sky , and occasionally they would kidnap people for experiments that their parents would not agree .
so we &apos;re interested in things like this .
early generations , these experiments couldn &apos;t do anything .
and i found out that the first technology was <unk> million years ago in <unk> .
we can learn a lot of learning about it .
and i look <unk> and trying to protect my child , because with a child , you don &apos;t let a minister alone , you don &apos;t have a minister .
and secondly , she tells us that she had a <unk> gang , but some tweaks for climb trees .
so far , our knowledge came from our ancestors , by the fact , the fossils , the fossils , the <unk> , the <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> studies is studying humanity &apos;s origin in the long ethiopia . he talks about how he found the oldest skeleton of a humanoid child , and what we can learn in africa about our human .
and if everybody &apos;s supposed to be wrong with the rules , of course you need a effective system to be aware of the and <unk> because we &apos;ve noticed , in all information , in information .
it &apos;s seen as high seas because the continent of <unk> <unk> was being .
we have to work locally , but also have to <unk> all the way .
we need to create a new paradigm of caution and respect .
carol <unk> says , &quot; i would pay numbers to do what i do . &quot;
and that was a pretty good idea .
to clear clear , i &apos;m journalists , i &apos;m a journalist , i &apos;m not a technologist , so i want to just design a sketch , like the present and the future .
finally , i think we all have to think about whether we want that to be our reality -- and if what it means for our idea of life , and for everything that comes to that .
it looks like oil .
the symptoms of the complex are that you have the strong and the opponent of the mind , the right solution , no matter how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried to write an article for the new york times and explaining how it works .
of course we can .
and make a lot of money .
it &apos;s up to , for example , higher than the americans &apos; s .
we &apos;ll try and do it . probably all go wrong .
<unk> immediately . &quot;
<unk> tried to try to see it again , but he never could prove the conjecture .
i &apos;m saying our approach is simply not portable .
china has been to to do this for 20 years .
we don &apos;t even slow down .
the future is <unk> .
yes , it &apos;s going to be ugly , and yes , it happens to be -- in our lifespan -- but we &apos;re more than able to overcome everything that &apos;s going to us .
and here they are in the game .
and what we need to think about is this : if you dance in the flames , what &apos;s next ?
and we thought we can take this debt on our children , but imagine what we &apos;re going to do .
everything else is <unk> .
that &apos;s the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what stage of development was the cell .
that shouldn &apos;t be amazing , isn &apos;t it ?
all we get is <unk> .
you will be able to focus on your listening , maybe the sensitivity , or increase sensitivity , can &apos;t do a number of things that we can &apos;t .
it &apos;s not a thousand years in the distance .
we should ban these cheap , simple <unk> and nobody for them to use them for their children . &quot;
and here we can see this one .
we can &apos;t risk losing the customer &apos;s confidence .
it only got 500 and he could have gotten up to 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge jar of <unk> that they got , and he said , &quot; come on a week when they &apos;re still sick . &quot;
the internet as we know it , the kind of web -- the things we all talk about -- is a little less than 5,000 days old .
of course , the internet has been on for more than 5,000 days -- the web only 5,000 days .
so if we say the machine that we &apos;re doing is now a <unk> , a human brain now if we look at the rate of rate that grows , there &apos;s six billion <unk> in the .
now it &apos;s not -- if you do a table and things work at work , a word , you &apos;re not part of the web but you will be . you &apos;ll be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people will make the broader sense of machine . &quot; in a sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas or words , if you want to resolve .
the last point i wanted to talk about is the idea we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
third , it will be more ubiquitous in our entire environment , and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i convinced that the second <unk> of jesus christ had occurred that it was dead <unk> , and i was prepared to be <unk> by god and be prepared for the to become his <unk> .
these are the deaths of <unk> .
and it allows everything to be . it makes everything sense .
so i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas about how we stack things .
this is a project we just completed in <unk> for a huge <unk> system that came straight from this process , and it &apos;s the result of a variety of forces that we &apos;re developing .
and that led to another project .
it &apos;s actually a false attitude , because the &apos;s probably likely to be more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are contributing to happiest young people .
and finally , of the most interesting projects -- a <unk> .
each of them is going to his neighbors .
it &apos;s like we &apos;d have to pay fees .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage , because we can affect our environment .
my story , that &apos;s the two brains . it may surprise you , your gut has a <unk> brain .
this is a very , very important thing , because there can be <unk> .
we &apos;ve learned to talk to the big brain , taste and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , at one point , we were all like animals and then no longer . &quot;
these are men and women who even name up even 250 stars at the night sky .
of course , the <unk> monks have said that .
the <unk> , the <unk> , the sun is on the sun is actually a <unk> <unk> , which is reflected on the holy <unk> of machu picchu , the <unk> , called <unk> picchu .
if you pray for the dead , you do the hands with these gestures that you put your thoughts into the sky .
here &apos;s the place where the big mother has <unk> the <unk> into the world , which has created the mountains and created the country that they call the the heart of the world .
they are unique <unk> of human imagination .
this material you all know is <unk> , but i think it &apos;s more of the toxic stuff .
i have a <unk> in it , and i fit it in , because in a hundred years my body can back without breaks into the earth .
it &apos;s a <unk> .
you want to be able to apply it anywhere in the world and don &apos;t have to take care of the <unk> or the <unk> , because you have many alternatives .
first , they start atoms in a special bottle .
i started a competition called &quot; dance your <unk> . &quot;
my country is <unk> by 15 trillion dollars .
and this is -- -- that &apos;s a much more <unk> than all the speakers in front of me and all those who are coming to come after me .
and she thought about my work of mathematical models that should promote a understanding of evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience may not seem to be -- from <unk> , cultural reasons , you think of it boring -- and find a different pattern of interesting -- a different pattern .

but , on the other hand , china is a <unk> . a <unk> <unk> .
you have facebook , we have <unk> .
but nevertheless , the <unk> itself can produce a very strong force , which is never had in history history of china .
that &apos;s why chinese look at this <unk> as a real medium , not just as a mere line .
like a great ted , right ?
so in the last three years , <unk> , really changed , they actually made more and more transparent , because they have no access to the data .
increasingly , chinese are seeing free speech and human rights as their favorite proposition , rather than one of america &apos;s <unk> .

this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , in the middle of the yosemite .
you can &apos;t let it go .
i &apos;m very interested in both of you .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of this , but there &apos;s actually a theoretical rationale for why technology is developing in a <unk> way .
now , evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years , and because of these interaction , evolution used the <unk> species to produce the next stage , which was the first step in technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; we can calculate the third dimension .
over the last 50 years , we had 28 percent of growth in the production of 28 percent of the growth in dollars .
another big revolution is the <unk> .
to bring back to our exponential growth of computing : 1,000 dollars of computing , is about the brain of a insect or a mouse .
and in <unk> , we &apos;re going to reach the full maturity of these trends , and they have to love how often the screw has been spun in the form of technology -- faster and faster when we get to that point .
you can bring blessing and <unk> .
they &apos;re harder .
they were taken out of the <unk> .
because there &apos;s nothing in there . well , it &apos;s not there .
dopamine is the object that corresponds to <unk> with <unk> .

the beetles are much less likely to get to the pill , when they &apos;re not carrying <unk> , as if they don &apos;t carry .
here &apos;s our <unk> experimenter .
let &apos;s play a <unk> and watch what happens .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
<unk> argument that it &apos;s fun to line into this big adventure is not entirely accompanied with my experience .
or , &quot; beautiful . you know , my grandmother next year , a <unk> is going to go into antarctica .
so the whole purpose of the presentation that you have to convince the vc that you are the entrepreneur that you invest and make a lot of money with it .
and besides the experience of doing a company or a something -- it doesn &apos;t have to be a company .
there &apos;s no financial support , there &apos;s no problems in there .
from that , you take it with -- on a solid , neat path to start up , right from the beginning .
if i happen to know someone who &apos;s made a device like this .
no , they &apos;re not .
then you give me a quick <unk> .
even if the competition is working for <unk> patterns ...
it was all positive , positive , positive , positive .
when you follow my foreign agency , you &apos;ll have a <unk> , very <unk> presentation , and that &apos;s great to <unk> who you are and emotionally <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know that , that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically , one of them is a beetle .
if you imitate something , maybe you can have a effect on it .
and then if you have enough , you can click another link .
we are at the end of the table , on the last of the culture that innovation doesn &apos;t value .
just as we think and behave , our <unk> is making .
we have a <unk> meme -- seriously .
but forgive me , the problems today are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
who are the largest <unk> ?
it &apos;s very <unk> .
we &apos;re thinking backwards .
through a drastic change , like transparency , like transparency , how , like <unk> , and collaboration collaboration collaboration , and collaboration , and not <unk> , these things are focused on outcomes .
because the challenge is the only way that things are always done , the only way for us to get rid of the old <unk> , and find new creative solutions to the problems of today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and if we share the ideas of play , we can transform bulgaria to something better .
the magazine magazine , i think , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to the <unk> , because the <unk> was to be the same .
after i had a gesture with her , she was very -- there i was accepted and i worked there about six months .
nine days ago , i had a fire .
you know -- all of the stuff .
my kids , <unk> and henry .
we were <unk> of magazines , our homework , but where we also looked at , we were surrounded by images like this .
this image literally came in seconds after i had the baby put into the arms and brought it over .
rg : oh , oh .
av : taboo number three : you don &apos;t speak about your won , but i &apos;m going to talk about my talk today .
the general opinion is that every aspect of my life has become better than <unk> since i was in the miracle of birth and family .
but you find that you &apos;re to lose control of the great way of losing the way that we think is a lot of meaning and what is extremely satisfying .
rg + av : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s a episode of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve seen all these &quot; star <unk> &quot; with the <unk> .
imagine , big , big , <unk> , today , how you would play personally , john <unk> walker shows how footage can be analyzed on the exact <unk> and <unk> and then <unk> it on <unk> wings .
well , since then , we &apos;ve been experiencing a period of extraordinary economic <unk> , the longest recovery in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , as well politicians may be in love , &quot; &quot; in the <unk> apple , &quot; without the the mine , &quot; as anyone can , their uncertainty can &apos;t hide .
well , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy , a <unk> , lightly man who was <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
but interestingly , this is a future where society is a few of <unk> from capitalism , which is how you integrated the dna <unk> innovation into society by trying things and then the ones working , <unk> and <unk> .
i want to show you a fascinating new hypothesis today , and some surprising new insights that i &apos;ve been working on , the relationship between the structure of the language they &apos;re talking about , and their propensity to save .
and if i want to talk right , i &apos;m constantly going to think about it constantly .
well , this is a <unk> theory .
please , let this device you can actually stick with your <unk> hand so that i can measure your balance .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in exchange for religious pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the ability to communicate over generations .
we banned the way they &apos;re always .
but i &apos;m about using it as a trump .
but they didn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
at the same time i was working on the field of <unk> , although i was a ph.d. in <unk> .
people and <unk> and <unk> and birds and everything , the red line here goes up . these are people , livestock and pets .
we focused on serious research of the future and producing products for the company .
let &apos;s take a look at the next video .
this was last night on the party , and -- you can see it just <unk> , and you can get any <unk> you want .
and he was <unk> about how people practiced the buddhist religion in india at the time .
and he goes back to the village as a <unk> man .
and he &apos;s got to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , the <unk> and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we look out . we take the sensation of memory to a mother and a lot of that in all the creatures in this meditation .
and you think about how <unk> things are when they &apos;re happy when they &apos;re happy .
and of course , they are cruel and pathetic to others .
although the change in your attitude is something for other beings , and you feel this new quality in you , and it &apos;s helps you to be , and it serves you as a model .
so the coffee cup , or the cup of <unk> , is one of society used tools to get the public health .
interestingly , complexity is very high .
we heard recently from bill gates recently .
so it &apos;s very , very simple , once you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four <unk> remarks , an example and two aphorisms .
and i don &apos;t want to stop it with details , but in the lower right corner , you &apos;ll an example of what we have .
do you have to do that ?
and the point that the <unk> of things that jimmy had already talked about , what is our new kind of organization , or better , how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things will be less and less able to be able to do it in the use of the , with the <unk> .
so instance , example astronomy , which yochai had already mentioned .
there will also be a professional , professional arguments .
so there will be no debate of two of the parts , but between these camps , there will be all sorts of interesting positions that are put out of people .
that costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to spend their <unk> , and actually , a team made it : between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing i thought about was to thank you .
but the truth is , life is right here .
so people call up and they &apos;ve got news like this .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m dressed batman to be my <unk> . &quot;
and the one that didn &apos;t have any reference , so it turned out that she just moved into a city and had a new job .
and in the last 35 years , i studied human behavior on the basis of everything , from genes about neurotransmitter , dopamine and <unk> , to the <unk> .
some of you also have it . and it &apos;s dependent on gender .
that was one of those cases , because there was no violence in her ancestors , but my father .
they &apos;re similar to each other as you can possibly be .
by the way , i &apos;ve been given an email today , which is that we &apos;ve finished the last part of atlas today .
and these guys are the weak force , perhaps the least familiar .
so if you want to know why the sky is blue or why <unk> atomic atomic , you should essentially be basically with a <unk> computer -- why dna has the shape she &apos;s got .
the comparison is that the people in this room are the higgs particle .
but it &apos;s really that with this theory , the physics seem to be the physical <unk> at the time of the big bang . and the model is not made to the goal that this is happening , but it seems to be .
they created this civilization , this beautiful image that turns darkness into light and allows us to see the civilization from space .
another big insight came from a study of the british state in 2010 , the <unk> maps of the <unk> <unk> player from the <unk> .
in a similar study in germany , researchers use researchers using <unk> to measure <unk> , and after they had <unk> <unk> , they had <unk> .
&quot; because the colors you ordered , not the european standard , &quot; he said .
&quot; safer ? why ? were more policemen here ? &quot;
we built the bright <unk> that people were <unk> people , people from <unk> , to think they were traveled abroad , when they were <unk> to pursue their cause .
president roosevelt said , &quot; believe you can do something , and you &apos;ve done it for half . &quot;
all over port-au-prince , entrepreneurs came out and offered <unk> for mobile phones .
an illustration of the leading power of technology is in kibera .
by 2015 , there will be three billion mobile phones in the world .
in the stores of the environment , <unk> and batteries were <unk> .
this flow of time is embedded in everything , in the erosion of a <unk> , in the <unk> that goes to the rose .
read an interview with a writer ?
and also , if i look at the big bear , i remember how i <unk> myself as a child to his head , not to <unk> his shoulders , and i feel again like this child again .
we &apos;ve seen how creative technology can be , and in our lives and our lives , we can choose those solutions , innovations and moments that don &apos;t take the flow of time , but make back .
my mother was a <unk> .
in every single refugee camp , she had to <unk> soldiers , which was my older brother mark , who was nine , and he wanted to make a child soldier out of him .
and i should do it alone .
take anything you want to get out of suitcase .
then i ended up in <unk> because i didn &apos;t <unk> my feelings .
thank you .
so almost all life on earth is going to remove about five times .
<unk> <unk> has the answer .
why should that be a role ?
so theoretically , we can grow every organ from any cell .
here &apos;s the rise in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the conclusion .
so when the rotors rotate the same speed , the robot is floating .
and you can see how robust control is .
and he does that as he moves out .
they are taking their neighbors .
this is showing you double double double , triple , <unk> , we can make them together teams as you can see here .
but the robot can also figure out where to go .
i can feel that . but there &apos;s so much of and i want to extend your horizon , open consciousness and change your view on honeybees .
this has been a huge problem for many years , essentially since the late 1980s , with the <unk> , which has been a lot of viruses , bacteria and <unk> .
they don &apos;t experience that .
they take the chefs for their courts , and the honey -- they &apos;re <unk> -- they use the honey on their bars .
bee dies . honeybees die when they stick , so they didn &apos;t want to do it either .
now , now , the question is , why is that ?
of course , we &apos;ve done it , especially over the last decade , to to <unk> the world with a dense chain of <unk> , with a chain of global rights .
and never before so many people were not aware of that fact .
in fact , not many of you know that our bread was not a european invention .
and especially the heart of in <unk> and china is <unk> up the <unk> .
<unk> has for most people , and here &apos;s not a lot of farmers who are not willing to be bad , to be bad , to be the environment , to be a big scale .
everything is on .
and so , while i do my bread , i &apos;m <unk> it , and i &apos;m trying to burn it , and i don &apos;t want to burn my hands .
it also has to be to keep the resources in the country that are available there , materials and materials .
you take someone like me , a scientist , analyze and and and develop a new technology , and i &apos;m sure the quantitative <unk> .
because i hope you &apos;re taking this today , a new connection with nature .
this was a couple days ago in <unk> .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is from the last year .
but <unk> <unk> was one of them . and shekhar kapur turned a film about her , <unk> queen , you should see .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this is a <unk> of <unk> .
this is a <unk> patient that was a 73 -- he was desperate to edit , but he decided to do this .
i like this slide because she &apos;s going to talk to you about what people really are doing to change and what &apos;s not .
if you eat a meal meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a <unk> . americans even eat more fat because ever , even more carbs . so the percentage is lower , but the actual number higher , so the goal is to reduce both .
one of the most sophisticated studies studies found that 70 percent of people were clogged , 65 percent of people had bad breath , 54 percent had headaches -- that &apos;s not a healthy diet .
on the other hand , everything is <unk> , <unk> .
i hope he doesn &apos;t hang up .
the film is based on a <unk> of f. scott <unk> .
two <unk> were involved in the project : warner brothers and <unk> .
and we had enough passion to make the <unk> and technology .
so we <unk> us from motion .
the number seemed to be infinite .
and that &apos;s the data we get from that , and then we &apos;re used for the model .
and this is what the finished picture was used in the movie .
it was a very , very , very early sample .
and we found this , in the middle of karnataka , karnataka .
and it has a own <unk> .
people are <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> past in which they lived in their lives .
we were <unk> -- two bedouin as drivers -- and imagine , this big one is a ocean from sand , 40 degrees c , a water bottle .
i think the camel is the best <unk> animal in the world . &quot;
and they use them like that as we see our <unk> .
we weigh our animals .
so let me show you another movie .
i don &apos;t notice until my temperature temperature 40 degrees celsius -- enough to <unk> a egg .
<unk> , thank you for inviting .
start a meeting with a poem . that would be an idea .
but how would it like you to have never know , the next day you &apos;re like a living god god , the world , your shoulders in the clouds , or whether you &apos;re sitting there in the <unk> , you know , you &apos;re wearing <unk> with your little <unk> ?
who could sleep for that night ?
but did you know that judy <unk> had a <unk> dollars a film , that <unk> d had the french army for victory and <unk> the <unk> of the room -- no waiting , i mean he invented the calculator ?
at the end , they sat in a tree and a <unk> switched hand toward the other .
and the human <unk> is more than that , but you would remove those two columns , probably not much left .
also , we have the problem with elephants , the problem that you can &apos;t build construction that would be too difficult for a single elephant .
one component of it is understanding . here &apos;s a <unk> : &quot; the ability to understand and share the feelings of others . &quot;
so now we &apos;re looking at more complex expressions . here &apos;s consolation .
the test is not clear for you .
there &apos;s a very simple task that you need to do .
a philosopher even wrote us that it was impossible to make a sense of fairness , because fairness was invented in the french revolution .
now it &apos;s not a lonely crazy , it &apos;s not two crazy , three is a lot and a lot of power .
the last decade i spent , taking pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good thing , the <unk> .
and i have to say , thank god .
so i stopped , in a way it was a success .
over the years , the serious <unk> can cause .
a.j. jacobs : how the healthy life of me almost
and i think that many of the <unk> are sharing this view .
a really cool thing .
now these studies are valid and they were reproduced , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask about the story of the story that &apos;s not going to tell .
a priest ?
finally , a group that believes the indus people are the ancestors of the people in the today &apos;s world .
on the left to the left , how many ? okay .
it can be useful to create more data that is then <unk> .
this sign is the most common of the indus script , and it &apos;s just in this text .
it turns out that in india , it &apos;s been a tradition of <unk> names on the basis of birth to the given time of birth .
space , we all know what it looks like .
this wire <unk> the <unk> that would make the name famous .
jansky had made the historical discovery that planetary could also give the waves as well as <unk> .
actually , all the young people in the city .
somebody who &apos;s sitting next to you -- this is ok in a <unk> , but if you &apos;re sitting on a <unk> , and somebody would sit down next to you , then you would <unk> .
the dalai lama likes to say -- he says , if you &apos;re going to get the idea of the <unk> idea , it &apos;s because you realize that yourself and your pain and your mind are a little bit of a playground for your intelligence .
so , take this wonderful thing that <unk> showed us . it was afraid of <unk> us .
a man in front of a tank , became a symbol of the world , a symbol of the resistance .
but what could you not have done anything else if you had had the modern communications , to create a sense that , in effect , that was wrong , that was going on , right ?
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate on global level , and organize globally with the challenges that are now in the and most global nature .
in the museum of children in rwanda , there &apos;s a photograph of a <unk> boy -- and the museum of the children of lives who have been left , when the <unk> of the rwandan uprising of rwanda million people died .
here &apos;s the task : help me build a vibrant <unk> <unk> in 3d .
they can move on very different <unk> -- they vary in the <unk> , the movement of the surface and the <unk> .
this one &apos;s <unk> as a floating algae .
boy : <unk> .
we slow down to see the spikes in action .
mark cutkosky , one of my partners , is an extraordinary engineer , which a technique called <unk> <unk> manufacturing , where he can bring claws directly into a artificial foot .
they look almost like aliens , and the secret of what they &apos;re doing to stick to are their <unk> toes .
here we go off the band-aid .
these <unk> structures allow the spines to be <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , very <unk> , very rough surfaces .
so <unk> <unk> <unk> societies , which serve as a <unk> , and males as well as females are able to find each other and choose a mate .
so if dolphins are less than 20 meters apart , they have to make less than half of the time of the <unk> .
if we think of animals as animals like dolphins , we need to be aware of the consequences of our surgeries that we thought were quite benign .
after the <unk> , the marine marine has made these systems accessible to the world to learn what the scientists could hear .
you just hear the low frequencies .
if males and females use this signal to find a mate and they &apos;re scattered , imagine what the implications of the impact of the natural state .
how ships can be made by the ships , and they found that with a better <unk> <unk> , that noise can be reduced by 90 percent .
they <unk> the speed by 50 percent .
we see foreign worlds , we see strangers <unk> , 300 , and more and more . and they &apos;re not like us .
you &apos;ve got all the possibilities .
we observe a continual rise in men .
and obviously there &apos;s one , the one hundred .
with initiatives like this $ 100 laptop , i <unk> me in the idea that we introduce a whole new generation of people to the old <unk> computer .
thank you .
i think that &apos;s not the problem .
our daily lives are , in fact , in a remarkable state , we say , in a <unk> .
usually it &apos;s one or two times a year .
and there &apos;s it !
but we &apos;re much more .
one part of the challenge was to try to <unk> rhythm and space by not just my hands -- when juggling is much more muscular -- but the rhythm of my body and feet , and controlling the balls with my feet .
and then they &apos;re crazy .
ok , because you don &apos;t understand what a <unk> is , i give you a little bit of a hint .
now , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , open . open .
you &apos;ve got somebody up here who &apos;s the ultimate principle of doing this whole life , ok ?
<unk> -- and then comes to silence . just a little number over time .
room and straight in the room work in a different way .
and then <unk> <unk> .
in this year -- you could show the slides -- -- this year we &apos;re wearing the <unk> with us , a project we helped with the design with the design .
we can call them on a <unk> , which is enables you to excavate more information about the artifacts while you &apos;re these <unk> .
( scott adams : i noticed i &apos;m going to be the expert expert in the <unk> .
and we &apos;re also known a new product tonight . it &apos;s the first time it &apos;s going to be shown .
right now , the farmers can only harvest in the rainy season , and not in the <unk> .
electrons disappear in a kind of <unk> , and then there &apos;s still energy . and energy can &apos;t see .
that &apos;s what he thought was what he was there .
potatoes , potatoes have 48 chromosomes . did you know that ?
good . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and somebody told to him , &quot; well , what &apos;s the point of this , sculpture ?
we &apos;ve been <unk> about about four years .
when google digitized a book , they bring it into a very beautiful format .
let me give you an example .
suddenly , in the middle of the 40s , everyone was excited .
but imagine you &apos;re not going to care about it .
but also , many very far , the seem to be done by propaganda .
if you get together , it means a &quot; <unk> &quot; with a a.
if i was to run this pink sound for longer than a few minutes , you literally stop hearing it .
many people escape to headphones , but these transform large , public spaces like this , shared <unk> , into millions of tiny personal personal .
they can do it in a beautiful place like a lake .
and finally , a acronym .
and i said , &quot; this is my job . &quot;
thank you very much for being here . we &apos;re all so grateful . &quot;
and they went away .
because they weren &apos;t on the pavement and couldn &apos;t see the exchange between me and my <unk> , a exchange that was fair to us , but strange to them .
now , i &apos;m telling you , in the <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of competition , because the arab spring is still growing , the <unk> is still -- what still ?
even this photograph was actually filmed in a police station , and on the floor , you see the people &apos;s <unk> of people who were been followed by the police .
the kids just do pictures in a class , the teacher gets them , they post them on the <unk> .
now talk talk about the brain and , <unk> , somewhere there is a <unk> .
this is something we can work on in our lifetimes , and i thought i could make a difference , and i was trying to get out of the <unk> to get into the <unk> .
but sometimes science has some other characteristics that they really do interesting .
what &apos;s going to bring us more data ?
there &apos;s something we think it &apos;s obvious , but wrong .
it &apos;s so defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t look at the alligator as a very intelligent , not in a human way .
in humans , we developed the most <unk> part of the neocortex , which is the name of the neocortex , and nature has done this little trick .
it &apos;s not that you &apos;re looking at and saying , &quot; what am i seeing now ?
it &apos;s not like a <unk> . not as a <unk> .
these are the things that are going to come first .
we need a police , we need a military , but only for defense .
you can see it on your pajama track . &quot;
she traveled because she was the the age of elections outside of the country .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and then , when she closed the door , grandma said , &quot; no , no , no , no .
you wash it like this : by hand .
this group uses three , everybody .
it &apos;s real .
it has been able to learn english and learn this as a foreign language .
the computer already , with one of three participants .
if you think about it , if you think about the u.n. employers , which were actually part of our <unk> , because that &apos;s what we did .
we repeated the experiment with the same groups , but one second delay one between the enlightenment is how we deal with the data , and the actual beginning of the <unk> .
the price for that is the <unk> of paradise .
and they moved and they rubbed each other and they left their arms down and they were <unk> .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and security and health , we &apos;re really bad at talking about character .
then you put personal <unk> , which <unk> like <unk> against bad breath .
i don &apos;t really feel comfortable with emotions .
the first gift , or talent , is <unk> -- the ability to peek into other people &apos;s minds and find out what they &apos;ve offer .
they own <unk> humility .
that &apos;s what the subconscious appeal is .
we found them between <unk> , raped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does your journey start ?
and it &apos;s not normal to live in a home .
what was my challenge ?
they need your empathy .
lexicography : the process of education .
well , first of all , i blame the queen because it &apos;s funny .
online dictionaries need to be different .
the bad words -- you see , if someone &apos;s thinking about a place and then it doesn &apos;t find him on the map , he &apos;s like , &quot; this card sucks ! &quot;
you &apos;re thinking , &quot; ok , if we think that words are tools that we use to give us our thoughts , where do you know that screwdriver are better than hammer ?
the <unk> has 33 different <unk> definitions for &quot; set . &quot;
and then there &apos;s this mike <unk> . mike <unk> lives in britain .
i &apos;ve been calling the the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary .
so , i &apos;m going to grab a chair .
and to make a long story short , i &apos;ve landed .
and with that , piece , for a piece , during those three days , you start to understand , why do i hear all this stuff stuff ?
you may be from a ted speaker , and that &apos;s what we can do with the conversation during the year , and then back next year , after the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the manufacturers don &apos;t have the <unk> in their cheap <unk> , because they &apos;re not sure what the public could do with a <unk> <unk> that could actually fold fold on the palm of the .
and there was a unsure that this was already <unk> , and it was not actually able to find the broadcasters .
rather than being the <unk> , you &apos;re going to get them .
and , &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call ourselves <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> and we live and work in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is the cartoon of a <unk> human .
we &apos;re arguing about the thesis of &quot; what the world needs now is nuclear &quot; -- right or wrong ?
and so far , there are only three <unk> of the coal and gas , water that &apos;s almost all over the -- and nuclear .
we &apos;ve become the russian warheads in the way that they transformed into electricity .
emissions emissions are equivalent of the emissions of all greenhouse gases and particles that are causing warming and and to co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that spreading nuclear weapons of nuclear weapons is nuclear proliferation , because we know that india and pakistan developed nuclear weapons in <unk> in <unk> .
for wind , the area is much bigger , but the <unk> is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear power , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need the support of both parties -- only one or two voices needed to be global warming in the senate , and this room can help .
we &apos;re not going to get enough energy from renewable sources .
i used to worry about the 10 years .
thank you .
this was -- my motivation was made by apollo <unk> .
for the first time , we have enough wealth in the hands of some fewer people , and the available technology that will allow us to explore the space of space .
26 groups from seven countries took the competition part , each between one and 25 million dollars .
<unk> -- we can bring them to the space station .
and the advantage for the power is the sum of the <unk> and the social <unk> .
would they surprise us , we were surprised ?
that means that space itself can cut . they can become incredibly small .
a challenge was how we can express this new algorithmic order in a column .
and what i didn &apos;t know at the time was because we only saw the outside , that the distances continued to expand within the column , and it was a pretty surprising discovery .
inspired by the process of <unk> , michael <unk> algorithms , the incredible , fascinating forms of millions of surfaces . no man could design them by hand , but you can build them . and they could revolutionize our understanding of architecture .
so , look at this image here -- many forms here dance for you .
it &apos;s a very rare disease .
this is a drug that &apos;s developed for cancer .
you can see the chip actually <unk> the <unk> .
it &apos;s a very young nation , which is led by young people .
and i think a lot of people here in the room , many of them are in the same position as i do .
so i think that women are going to be leaders in our society , because they realize it &apos;s very important for their future generations to get our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve realized that since more and more people have use tools to give their stories , to express their stories , to show their photos and tell their own stories with their own voices .
at the same time , we invite them to come up and explore our part of the world .
that &apos;s how i got more or less than anything .
so i thought , &quot; maybe , if i do these ants a few apartments , they pull up there . &quot;
this is called &quot; <unk> house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do this ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back the day .
and it was ...
my work , roughly , , five or seven weeks , six or seven weeks ; you can &apos;t keep it .
and i checked it around , and i shaped the <unk> .
so i cut the needle .
it &apos;s a very busy work , but the best things come in small <unk> .
they expect their employees that they asked what they asked them to do , if they &apos;ve done the task , can they do extra .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of being , this absolute <unk> of consciousness , consciousness , an absolute center of compassion and love that defines the primary properties of divinity .
my <unk> body flew in one direction , my <unk> bike into the other .
i put all the walks that i probably wouldn &apos;t do with you , the <unk> , which i wouldn &apos;t ruin you , the friends that i couldn &apos;t see , the friends that i couldn &apos;t see to you the <unk> that i couldn &apos;t go to with you .
because then you don &apos;t need the <unk> .
and if you &apos;re going to go back from the back , the wind , you can just <unk> it , and it &apos;s <unk> in the dirt . &quot;
20 years ago , the doctors had cut my leg and hoped , and there was a 15 <unk> chance of .
how i became more and more involved -- and at that point in my life , i was probably 14 pounds lighter than i am now .
and nobody <unk> this modern <unk> in my eyes more than david black .
running upright , you say , is the threshold of what human power is doing .
he &apos;s a president of the international union for <unk> , which is the least <unk> name i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born for three and a half months , and it was really a fantastic <unk> of him .
so as soon as i tried to approach the piano , i was <unk> .
and at the end , you were so quickly that things like the &quot; flight problem were not a problem , right ?
do you want to hear me ?
dp : &quot; tiger <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t get that .
they &apos;re fighting to reclaim their own lives in this forest , in a world that is still clean , a world that &apos;s not <unk> yet , in a world that &apos;s not yet yet .
so we know that today that they are capable of doing the research that has been impossible impossible to do when i started .
the long <unk> connect to mom who &apos;s developing during this long childhood , and also the siblings , can keep all life , and that can be to 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the huge camp of the <unk> in the forest need meat meat , and the <unk> that are <unk> in the <unk> and and there lived in their wonderful lifestyle for so many years , they spoiled .
yesterday , somebody said .
we have now in every state , and the problems in florida are other than the ones in new york .
do you come and get <unk> me down here ?
out there in the politicians ?
so what we want to do in the lab is pretty much the same , but with a couple dozen of different kinds of molecules -- a <unk> reduction of complexity , but still trying to create something more .
she &apos;s actually very <unk> . and when she &apos;s , she doesn &apos;t really do anything .
now , where they &apos;re all experts for protocells , we &apos;re going to play with these protocells .
and we see again the self-assembly of these bodies of <unk> that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black blob in it represent this black mud -- this <unk> , very complex , organic sludge .
in his lab , martin <unk> , &quot; protocells , &quot; experimental versions of chemicals behave like living cells . his work shows how life on earth could have been and perhaps elsewhere .
this is a <unk> to take your tadpole for a walk .
what is this -- where did you know that ? you took it .
but if we did that in everybody -- every fire , we could redefine the emergency age .
<unk> is the filth that &apos;s otherwise <unk> in her nice pink lungs , and it &apos;s associated associated with it .
the birds could jump from one to another .
you can talk to him a <unk> news . you can talk to him .
but keep those flock , will require a great toll from our planet .
next , let &apos;s take the skin cells and multiply it in a <unk> .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> for thousands of years , with products like wine , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that when we do the world of our research , we see that there &apos;s almost a universal pursuit of people to have a car .
let me just talk about hydrogen .
this is a huge finite energy to create mobile energy .
if we can see this <unk> future , other people can .
you had to survive .
and we were sure to be our school district to be a funding and support .
because why should our students drive so far from their place ?
it became a book , then a a demo .
there was an incredible idea that had a crazy idea .
there on the west coast , they destroyed their forest .
but in this picture , you can see how we started building the <unk> , which was soon a big <unk> of brazil .
so , when i was a to start my <unk> , i studied the <unk> subject of the <unk> .
if you go in the south , you see the expansion of new york city as it once was , at the end of the american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are one of the most fragile places .
or the <unk> , which <unk> , the <unk> , insects and <unk> places .
maybe there was a <unk> there .
there &apos;s so much power to unite science and visualizing together , that this is something that is like this . it &apos;s like both sides of the <unk> .
and we have a really dramatic level of this in our society currently .
so i don &apos;t seem to go closer to that .
you can &apos;t do what is , of course , to be .
this is a <unk> building .
one example we all know is this one cell phones . right ?
and it &apos;s all about this question -- of course , in a very artistic and most transformative way .
but it &apos;s happening everywhere , and these tools are parts of us that help us create it .
seriously , clap them -- that &apos;s really great .
alex <unk> : a sustainable future
you might think that this could be a big problem for a law , but congress seems to be very reluctant to get it to .
but if you make lots of high-quality copies , you &apos;re selling , it &apos;s not okay .
and some of the things we share is we &apos;ve made things that we &apos;ve found , and every single option caused the unfortunate interpretation of the industry .
that &apos;s the simple thing .
i had a very <unk> , <unk> , expensive education in india , and that &apos;s almost broken me .
and i thought , i start a barefoot college -- college just for the poor .
a professional is somebody who is a combination of competence , confidence and belief .
when i said that , they said , &quot; do you show us what &apos;s possible . what do you do ?
the whole electricity comes from the sun .
democracy , <unk> , how to do your country , what you should do , what you &apos;re going to be arrested , what you should do if an animal is sick .
comes there to tensions , the attendance in the schools , comes between teachers and parents , and the teachers can <unk> the teacher and parents parents the village and say , &quot; give you your hands .
you use language .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , sir .
a <unk> .
and our <unk> created one of the largest , dynamically <unk> computers in the world for this kind of <unk> .
you can see here the <unk> along the <unk> that we &apos;ve created as an artist for the scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there &apos;s data of these two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
&quot; i &apos;m going to do it physically , financially , emotionally , mentally , and almost any other way , &quot; i don &apos;t know a minute .
he didn &apos;t give him the money , and of course , he had six months later , the same idea .
in this case , it &apos;s because they &apos;re being used in the experiment that i &apos;m going to share with you , prints by <unk> images .
we collected our materials , went out of the room , and we waited half an hour .
i &apos;ll show you why .
they were two pictures , and they had two beautiful <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> of them , and we said , &quot; what of of you would you give ? &quot;
we take a whole new group of <unk> <unk> and saying , &quot; you know , we give a <unk> and we can make it in two different ways .
<unk> that are the big car and the <unk> waves are beautiful .
voices : it &apos;s going to the air . oh , shit .
&quot; mama , don &apos;t start . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition is not from the <unk> of <unk> , but keep on back to a time before we put stories on <unk> <unk> or <unk> on <unk> <unk> .
the kind of food , yeah .
the kind of <unk> roof , you know .
and so we had my father his <unk> , because i knew he would kill me when i left them driving , so we get into the car .
&quot; and did this guy like a blue uniform and a <unk> expression in the face ? &quot;
do i really want to in ? because if i don &apos;t have <unk> needle to make sure that i &apos;m not to get enough metaphors for your taste ? -- could i never come out .
see ? we &apos;re a secret club with a secret player .
she says , &quot; ma , you have to look ! &quot;
&quot; i agree for the little old lady , &quot; damn , damn . &quot;
she &apos;s up the car . &quot;
i &apos;m really afraid .
so what &apos;s the social outcome of this ?
where can i go and who are ?
and if we have , we will decide , how many kilometers we drive , what <unk> where we live and work .
smart <unk> on the station , and you see exactly where your bus is on , and when it comes , and you can buy your tickets in real time .
i want us to take the wireless out of the wireless , and i challenge that this network should be linked to open standards for everyone .
and they came here in the late 1960s .
and for all of you who came with a mental illness , you know what a challenge can do .
i said i wanted to tell the <unk> , i wanted to share with you the three a &apos;s awesome , and i wanted to leave you with a <unk> .
because they were three years old .
and so what i love about this story is that rosey grier is just an authentic person , and that &apos;s what authenticity is .
i ate <unk> with <unk> . &quot;
you can sleep in clean <unk> .
j it &apos;s so many that this is the problematic thing .
and i found it strange about speculate than it was a competition , about a fresh wound .
it was a white white <unk> , <unk> , that wasn &apos;t a <unk> for the city .
it looks pretty simple , but it was a <unk> .
people were two things -- they were amazed about the destruction , but there was also a sense of the <unk> of the new yorker of new yorkers that i found very moving .
because at the four platforms along the ridge ridge -- where one is the improved version of a <unk> -- we knew that it had to be mobile to be able to respond to <unk> conditions and the changed definition of ground zero .
we have the ability to rethink our thinking about cities .
dr : i was an honor .
and i know that children suffer every year of concussions .
if -- god forbid -- somebody here , <unk> and a concussion , most of us would be fully <unk> most of us in a period of several hours to a few weeks .
you have to deal with the problems that we &apos;re talking about today .
it turns out , tom saw that a helmet for 20 dollars was a good way to keep a 100,000 <unk> .
it &apos;s not true , but it was tony blair during the long forum in 2005 , when his doodle , of course , &quot; discovered &quot; and he was described .
in other words , they have a common and growing complexity of visual language that &apos;s happening in <unk> sequence .
it was told that there was no cure .
today , all countries are committed to provide patents for drugs that have at least 20 years .
it depends on the <unk> of the inquiry , to <unk> their patents and make them available to others .
in orlando , the same kind of stadium , people sat in the middle of the sun , afternoon at very high humidity , and they didn &apos;t feel .
you can adapt everything to make your well-being .
he offers all these services , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and small things that you do online , but for people who are just connecting to the digital world .
the question was , how do you make this teacher from teacher teacher ?
let &apos;s see what he &apos;s doing here .
and the husband &apos;s husband , he was also sick by the exhaustion of his wife .
but visual complexity still is very big .
well , <unk> had a <unk> on our studies .
now , if we feel emotion , we show them .
and you could get the impression that unhappy people take another structural position within the network .
this is my <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re both carbon , and yet one of them two <unk> in themselves , which are special , on the left , and they get <unk> , which is soft and dark .
so to get that to a little bit , let me just pull it back for a moment .
and being older is not easy .
under the same circumstances , older people are their cognitive resources , like <unk> and memory , more on positive information than on negative .
we cost life .
and so they &apos;d like me , &quot; i &apos;m going to perform this <unk> for this girl on this bar , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
kid david : it &apos;s so that i , honestly , often don &apos;t know what happens when i dance .
they &apos;ve called me brother and uncles , and i &apos;ve been invited over a time over five years .
<unk> : the second treaty of fort laramie treaty clearly the <unk> of the great sioux nation and the <unk> of the lakota hills .
the treaty fort fort <unk> <unk> that at least three three of the <unk> would have to sign for land .
they were tired of contracts .
the tuberculosis rate is eight times higher than the average average .
so what do we do ?
today ? child mortality since 1960 was 24 percent since 1960 , six percent .
you get it either as a pill or a syringe , you have to take it every day to regulate the <unk> .
if we like to do it here , like people , to do with people ...
but basically it makes a lot of sense .
it &apos;s called : are you smarter than a <unk> ?
bmw is a very safe car .
now the problem for bmw is this car safe .
now you &apos;re going to think , &quot; if my life depended on that , i of course i &apos;m going to use it every day . &quot;
we need to connect this with a scientific method .
it &apos;s something different than actually making a effective ad campaign .
what &apos;s nothing new .
the lights are getting dark .
we &apos;re doing it for our customers .
we have the in the sun .
now , logic -- to look logical , you can be from this position here here -- without moving the wrist .
i &apos;m going to intervene now . if every time -- another person -- not always the same answers .
so , if you &apos;re interested in this , i &apos;m going to present some more <unk> .
here i have to look at the beginning of the beginning , so i can have started my cards during the <unk> -- oh , we should have started -- no problem , no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : pardon ?
what what do i use ? the lady or the five ?
lg : but you see your hand .
wait moment moment -- take any card .
another color . lg : diamonds , perfect .
compassion .
<unk> , yes ? zoe : yeah .
here -- are all the cards -- here -- are all the cards -- right ?
and finally , the king -- in exactly -- five seconds .
some of you seem to know this child .
after i back back , i made my whole company a <unk> . &quot;
if you had tone-deaf , you could not turn down the car .
let &apos;s see what really happens here .
i always tell my students , &quot; if you have a fallacy , you always have a eyebrow , everybody recognizes . &quot;
imagine the person , and at the same time , they follow from b to e , and they &apos;re hear everything that chopin had to say .
i had an amazing experience . i was 45 , i was 45 , and i had a insight in the world .
she came to auschwitz when she was 15 , her brother was eight , her parents lost her .
so ladies and gentlemen , the jury , look at this .
if you &apos;re the fastest of all today , you get 20 dollars . &quot;
but for tasks of the 21st century , this <unk> , the <unk> doesn &apos;t work -- often often doesn &apos;t work , and often doesn &apos;t matter .
think about your own work .
the standard standard is lower .
this is the building blocks of a completely new entry for our businesses .
this one day , intense autonomy has led to a whole series of <unk> that might have been there .
do it because you like to do it .
the aluminum is used because of its light .
in a series of 55 spheres , it &apos;s accelerating , every sphere and its <unk> <unk> , to this little earth .
and the blue side , the <unk> , is in the other direction .
this is evolved in many <unk> in the years .
the <unk> on the object would be probably a bloody <unk> image of the earth .
but it always leaves those 10 percent or more back , most of the most <unk> or the <unk> .
<unk> dollars and in a study for <unk> dollars .
and nonprofit ngos have to be <unk> , courageous , big efforts to try to try new <unk> , from fear that their call is going to be their call through the dirt .

that &apos;s what he does .

so kleiber is about the process .
as a <unk> , we tell ourselves a lot of stories about the future and about what steps we could do from here .

and in the climate change , it &apos;s not really <unk> .
and it &apos;s a process that makes a really pleasure .
she &apos;s about to keep you forward .
and the <unk> said , &quot; if we don &apos;t have transition , we would have to invent all of these infrastructure infrastructure for the first time . &quot;
but there &apos;s a problem .
the budgets are not really balanced . and up to some extent , the games that they play to hide this , the theme so much , so that you can &apos;t see what the are quite obvious challenges .
in fact , there are five states that are worse , and really only four states that are not big to this big challenge .
and even if you &apos;re doing this , you could get funding out there .
it should be more like private accounting .
but i had a <unk> when i went to <unk> <unk> , and i was in a <unk> in my life , and i was trying to decide between music and medicine .
if you laugh , you know .
many years after the solar-powered clocks , a young lady , i knew that sex may be so good for the five senses .
the <unk> is served all five senses on a extreme level of all five senses .
of course , the five senses are not the only thing that makes life interesting .
we are all born as artists .
if you have a conversation like this , the child must come up with the next answer to <unk> what it started .
but her parents tell them , &quot; it will be used by the waves . &quot;

let &apos;s start with how i came to this point .
there will be stronger storms and greater flooding .
if you go , there will be a warming in the future .
but the delay is exactly the expectations .
the economic consequences are almost unthinkable .
a lot of the species is being threatened by extinction .
now , if a car car is happening , it &apos;s critical that we &apos;re not only making the stuntman , but the crew .
something else was used to be used , and once it was , it was all you had .
but today we use a <unk> .
more is not a <unk> .
in 1960 , joseph <unk> had done a little bit of incredible air force air force .

we don &apos;t have all facts . we don &apos;t even know what tools are going to be or what we &apos;re going to be looking at in the uniquely position to get to be able to get to the occasion before the <unk> behavior shows .
how are you going to increase it ? &quot;

and that was what i proposed : we might be able to make comics on an infinite canvas : the <unk> and the y-axis and the y-axis and the <unk> .
this is from daniel <unk> <unk> in britain .
maybe all of you might be , for a long time , but for me , as i was so much that , i had never seen this much of the difficult day day , i never saw the <unk> of the <unk> challenge .

&quot; uh-huh ! &quot; they found out that it was a <unk> .
i know if i have to beat myself . &quot;
he made the machine run all night . if anyone was at stephen wolfram , who invented this whole thing .
now , we &apos;re 50 years later -- it &apos;s a kind of <unk> animation animation .
now , in the next 18 minutes , i &apos;m talking to you , four americans who are still alive , die , die because of their diet .
that &apos;s a global problem .
<unk> city .
and he &apos;s got the snout full of it . he &apos;s tired of having his friends to his friends and his community .
they want to -- they want to control themselves .
you know that it remained in that long understanding of a long understanding .
we don &apos;t teach kids .
and most kids get them .
well , supermarkets .
if you can cook , there &apos;s no role for time .
all america , a lot of wonderful things about this is that we just look back .
misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a clever group of politically <unk> hackers that &apos;s <unk> in 2011 .
the net combines everything , and it &apos;s going to give very soon a lot of human activity .
interestingly , anonymous uses his <unk> information but not for financial profit .
he explained me how he was going in 2003 and 2004 , and he took 10,000 dollars on tour , and 30,000 10,000 dollars from the atm machines here , using <unk> credit .
he was born in <unk> in a stable and ugly middle family , his obsession with play as a teenager , led him to the <unk> .
and most of them , with the exception of parasites and <unk> , were not showing real social skills in the outside world -- just in the net .
i think there are several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go into the details , but some of them are .
but they &apos;re all of the market , and what &apos;s the market is mostly -- number one is the big demographic <unk> .
we also found a lot of examples for dead big boxes that were transformed into all kinds of social institutions , many schools , many churches , and many libraries , like this one .
and finally , i expect the streets to float through the <unk> of the mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it has helped to <unk> that eight of 13 local <unk> in <unk> plans have <unk> <unk> .
the stream was taken by the parking lot .
their inhabitants are different than typical <unk> , but they &apos;re less than cities than cities .
he said , &quot; his vagina , &quot; she said , &quot; is a whole <unk> . &quot;
but actually , it wasn &apos;t starting there , it started with a conversation with a woman .
it &apos;s a gender that &apos;s a basic resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a <unk> , and the way it exists in the body , and i think it &apos;s a real meaning , our bodies to our heads -- that this separation has created a division that is also often made by the decision .
i want to tell this little story about my own beginnings , because that &apos;s really good with the happiness and agnes .
maybe it &apos;s on my roommate &apos;s south carolina , which is not much smaller than today &apos;s day of medicine , and once dreamed of a future as an independent country .
well , maybe he was too generous , because he stayed there , long after the <unk> <unk> through the nazis , even after the <unk> and <unk> in budapest .
and he got the same answer : &quot; bring me the best workers they can find , and if they &apos;re good enough , i &apos;ll hire you . &quot;
and clearly , it says , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was so beautiful .
&quot; aha ! &quot; said dr. robicsek . &quot; i went to the movie alone . &quot;
as i said , he <unk> too much .
and you can really imagine it .
you know what what you &apos;re looking for .
but we take care of the most difficult cases and we take the other ones for the next day .
so we came up with these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother went along , during the soviet union .
and if you think it &apos;s not going to be , you get it as long as you go on .
what i want to try and do with this is to demonstrate the points .
and what i &apos;d like to point out later in the presentation is 50 percent of the u.s. states are under the ocean .
it &apos;s <unk> because photons can &apos;t reach the average depth of the ocean , which is 100 miles a mile ; the <unk> is on <unk> miles .
and so we went along the way into an area alongside the <unk> , and we found the missing heat there .
so i started developing a new <unk> , with a <unk> that replaced me , and i don &apos;t have to go into my vehicle .
we &apos;re going to find the <unk> .
and i looked at her yesterday , she &apos;s up in seattle . ok .
but i would leave a child with a license to control control .
in some parts of the world , in south africa , is very difficult to be difficult .
when we saw the impact of the <unk> , andrew and i decided we had to zoom in to address so many people as possible best education .
what was this special thing about these courses ?
the video will cut out all the minutes and the student will ask a question .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues &apos;s minds that multiple <unk> isn &apos;t so bad thing .
in terms of certain courses , you can ask wondering which the most <unk> are and how to help the students to fix them .
we actually see the beginning of either by a personalized <unk> , or through <unk> feedback that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe and about what my first thought was , what infinity means when i was a kid .
and in our society , of course , it &apos;s mainly about making other reality .
i &apos;ve got my doubt about the values of newton science , like for example , that you &apos;re rational in a <unk> .
so you can understand my surprise when i was reading to reading the new yorker , that alan greenspan , the <unk> of the <unk> , said , &quot; ayn rand , his <unk> mentor .
i think you can do about those funny things that have and not have the ones that don &apos;t have , and so i don &apos;t even know , from the fact that i don &apos;t have any jokes about the <unk> and the <unk> .
i &apos;m going to <unk> this old times of the <unk> , i &apos;ll tell you .
he said i had to pay him more respect because it can take up to 18 years to get a really good job .
huh ? yeah ? what ? i can &apos;t hear them . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid that this active somebody doesn &apos;t like us .
i &apos;ve thought about moshe <unk> thoughts about beauty that she <unk> us yesterday . there in his book , says that trickster can be able to build beauty .
george w. bush : what the defense of our security costs is also costs , and what costs our freedoms , we need to pay the price . &quot;
10 years ago , no astronomer has come to the idea -- well , or very few astronomers -- that there are planets outside of our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he constantly <unk> the idea that an experiment could go on and produce a particle accelerator that would make the world .
we need to have the same test with biotechnology as <unk> .
and of course , we don &apos;t want to see .
so what can we do ?
and now the worst thing is .
we spend a lot of money on making sure that we don &apos;t die at a hedge , but we &apos;re almost nothing to do that , and yet it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to get caught on the wrong foot .
i hope that &apos;s going to be .
it &apos;s very , very important , because this is the system , the <unk> , that came from the planet , and it &apos;s time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing realization , and we &apos;ve only been very recently .
and that &apos;s what the system is doing , a number of <unk> in the southern hemisphere , in these circles .
anyone who &apos;s come up to this is just to pick up the database , and can the information that &apos;s needed for everything that &apos;s gone on .
we &apos;re to ban the wave , the technological possibilities .
in a earthquake , great amounts of these new microbes that we never saw before , from the sea floor .
the <unk> john <unk> creates a network of <unk> cameras and sensors that makes our oceans to global global interactive lab -- and a <unk> of the world &apos;s world .
so i think optimism moves the architecture forward .
so again , radical versus conservative .
the <unk> against the <unk> . you know , too often you want to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know it &apos;s true ; the cathedrals , as unexpected , will be unexpected .
but i prefer to play something completely unknown , and even in mistakes instead of <unk> the same thing , so that it &apos;s from its insignificance .
risks of rooms that were never as <unk> as they should be in a groundbreaking city .
there are the emotions of the victim .
daniel <unk> builds on a big ideas . he calls 17 terms that &apos;s to be basically the vision of architecture -- raw , unexpected , <unk> , radical -- and inspiring for every bold entrepreneur .
it also has the lowest <unk> of all the cars of this size .
does something really happen , or will there be a few <unk> ?
em : it &apos;s got to be . if you don &apos;t , we &apos;re in great trouble .
so buying this capital , and it &apos;s installed the <unk> on the roof , and then the <unk> , or <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , which is lower than the electricity bar .
we &apos;ve almost failed , but we &apos;ve gone out of 2008 .
it &apos;s similar to a jet jet .
how about all the world could be a person in the world ?
look at that .
boy , if you &apos;re eating our livestock , and you see a cheetahs like he eats one of our goats , he &apos;s very nervous . then just go to him .
we were hungry .
our tradition looks like this : in every lattice of atoms , there &apos;s a holy fire .
we &apos;ve been able to build the world wildlife fund to build the very small programs with <unk> degrees .
it &apos;s also very important -- we invest the money in enlightenment for aids and hiv .
<unk> -- again , a <unk> <unk> , a lot of the world &apos;s <unk> -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful means .
and we &apos;re hiding this price behind giant .
dan <unk> and alice <unk> lead the <unk> revolution for <unk> food .
<unk> , <unk> , oysters , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- these were the known species .
it &apos;s like a <unk> of protein .
science science sees the world through the mind , <unk> , things that can be measured and described , but there &apos;s a framework for knowledge and insight .
from the plan of a few cameras , after three weeks , a plan was 25 <unk> .
this is the natural cycle .
this wouldn &apos;t usually do a photographer , a picture of a picture , right ? but sometimes it must be to show the dimensions .
and here you see the glacier pulling back .
this is a couple of cameras .
could india be the origin of the origins or a global center center innovation , just as it has become a global center for <unk> and <unk> ?
when we asked to talk to people in the <unk> , they said , &quot; we &apos;re working on global products . &quot;
you can &apos;t be a professor if you &apos;re not a student .
the best hospitals who were going to go to the treatment , as well as in births , <unk> , heart disease , heart disease , <unk> , 4 a.m.
it works a little bit like -- this is a recently <unk> <unk> for four in the morning .
i said i know a <unk> message when i see one .
everyone in our society comes with cancer -- if not personal , then through a beloved people , a family member , a colleagues , a friend .
in this protocell , the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
we have applied tumor treating fields over 20 different types of cancer , and we see this effect in all of them .
he got the <unk> .
but what we can see is that in six month of tumor tumor , it starts to be <unk> .
so that &apos;s just the beginning .
this is a new <unk> , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 feet deep , and they collect rain from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe , and from their courtyard .
so , water from 300 , 400 kilometers away , soon it looks like this .
somewhere , a stream or a <unk> walk through this scene .
this is called &quot; <unk> . &quot; we &apos;ve got <unk> and water .
and you have to go further .
these are the beautiful ones that we saw on one of the pictures .
and <unk> are by 27 percent : 600,000 fewer people a year get hiv in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent of india .
they will get the jobs in textiles that people bring out of the <unk> and bring them to the way of industrialization and prosperity .
and the countries at the right , because you see the <unk> , and basically every country with a <unk> of , say , is less than 5,000 dollars , a <unk> of say three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india didn &apos;t grow that right .
buy african products .
but i think that a much bigger problem with it is that these logic -- that we should not leave ipods and not bombs -- i mean it would give a great title for thomas <unk> &apos;s new book .
so , 500 people have come and and four of them have chosen to visit the institution and to <unk> them to then to reclaim it .
so now , people who are in planning with 2020 , not necessarily change anything about it , because they &apos;re still the dictators who control the agenda .
<unk> <unk> : do the internet <unk> worst expectations ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he sat with us younger fellows .
because for me , who lived in this time and lived in this <unk> , the question was , &quot; do you want to ? &quot; either sex or drugs -- and drugs we didn &apos;t use .
i was like paralyzed , guys .
as indians , and as a as a politician , and i &apos;m quite a <unk> , who is our country , worried , all the talks about india as a new <unk> , even the new superpower .
in other words , all kinds of <unk> stories tell us about countries , regardless of whether the people want you to come to daylight or not .
but then , in the back of our country , pretty slowly , it took about half an hour to a call to call it .
it can &apos;t understand the dialogues .
this can have profound consequences . ok .
and those of you who have been here to be surprised to be surprised to see how many <unk> on the <unk> are there on the <unk> , who explain the <unk> .
i went home and i was doing a little bit , and i found some startling statistics .
<unk> <unk> : a bath with no water .
and now i feel like george bush .
now , this title , this phrase , comes from a critic , a early critic , and this is a passage i just love , and i would like to read you .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it would have been , mother nature had a problem : how about everything in the world , we get chimps to mate ?
that &apos;s the hardest part , the one who &apos;s not obvious , and so i &apos;ve picked it up for the end .
ok ? stop . this is what it &apos;s .
i don &apos;t know why there are <unk> <unk> , but anyway , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
i actually suspect that the most likely probably know a lot of reasons why we want new things very , very quickly .
it &apos;s what it looks like . you should see something like this .
bob mckim did another very -- another version of this exercise in a very famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned this over time : you get a much better brainstorming , much more creative results , if all of you get to the rules .
and suddenly there was a productive conversation about design around a <unk> object .
they &apos;re a little skeptical , i &apos;ll come back to that .
you know what it feels like , all these insecurity , as long as you get back in the corridor , as the doctors get in one of the transitional practices , you &apos;re going to take a <unk> case , and you wonder what &apos;s going on here .
and that &apos;s how we all would feel secure and have a good time because we agreed agreed on the rules and agreed with it .
we do everything that &apos;s going to succeed . but then , if we have gone there , we think we &apos;ve done it . we &apos;re going to get ourselves ready and just stop doing what has done successful .
i was faster , but i was just as depressed .
i &apos;ve learned that success is not a one-way street .
and the <unk> is just full of hot girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; -- hopefully , for the last time in the public .
he demonstrated sure everything fit .
there were 900 people in this .
and the second thing is that people obviously seem to have a actual connection .
these are questions .
as you see in modern modern liberal democracies , society , the state , the state of not only to define our selves , to shape our ourselves , but also require it from us .
it means that we fulfill our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers , the kinds of questions i want to to you today -- the question : what are the intentions that come to the application when you design something ?
so i said , and my colleague sebastian <unk> us that there &apos;s better better ways to give .
and we succeeded .
i &apos;ll give you a fall in the fall .
he <unk> them in the right position , <unk> them up with his nose and he <unk> .
we learned the first surprise .
there had to be some kind of <unk> of a <unk> to create the troubling of force and the speed that we observe and the the <unk> of the system .
a load load is a load cell , and it &apos;s actually a <unk> load with a crystal inside .
this is the <unk> -- here &apos;s the heel , and this is hitting the load and the load cell .
very , very <unk> solution to the particular problem .
and <unk> : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean .
i think this is one of the most beautiful classical <unk> projects ever built .
i don &apos;t know any other <unk> , i don &apos;t even know , <unk> , that this is a three-dimensional space .
now look at this -- he just just me standing .
the submarine that was last year was this one .
<unk> is the understanding of architecture as a <unk> , <unk> , -- please excuse me to be the obvious example -- not the right approach that we need to choose .
basically , new york has been built on the back of the <unk> , our streets over their shells .
in these eight <unk> chambers , little <unk> , are basically <unk> .
so you were walking around in london , and you was overwhelmed with this <unk> .
finally , aristotle created a map of the outbreak .
and that &apos;s what every second week .
i &apos;ve her her at the top of the temple .
and in this area of the amazon , the amazon was discovered .
the other side of the field is <unk> <unk> , where actually is supposed to be osama bin laden . that &apos;s <unk> .
this was one of the great <unk> .
this is the <unk> . let me continue and go to the hubble <unk> field .
but then you come to jupiter , and that &apos;s 40 minutes long away . that &apos;s a problem .
that &apos;s going to be the part of the universe that &apos;s going to be about .
we have only a million galaxies .
so the stuff that seems to know in the picture , dark matter .
when you saw this picture , you haven &apos;t seen much in it .
this is a simulation that was performed with 1,000 processors a month , just to see this visible .
with <unk> , we &apos;re starting to start a resolution that corresponds to this image of the earth that you can actually see the complicated pattern of the earth .
and of course , we &apos;re stressed out .
47 percent .
that &apos;s crazy . we &apos;re doing this all the time , even in the everyday .
i stumbled into a vicious cycle , which led to many pains and problems with joints so that i could keep almost nothing .
so i &apos;ve been wondering , could you be creative if you &apos;re looking for the limitations ?
this was not happening in tomorrow .
the ongoing thing is <unk> <unk> , as as a <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
stalin &apos;s <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , killing millions of <unk> , and in the 1940s , they looked at the nazis that were <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and many of the women back then became a germany after germany .
that &apos;s the conversation that &apos;s about . &quot;
and as a <unk> , the idea that most of us was that we were what we learned in the virtual world about us , and our identity , could use a better life in the real world .
we used to be in a new way of being together alone .
human relationships are <unk> , chaotic and <unk> .
it <unk> them .
because the moment when people are alone , even for a few seconds , they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , getting panic , they grab them , they reach after a electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger , because in fact , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we didn &apos;t have any of the <unk> that we had predicted , and some of our graduate students had , and quite often -- -- i felt quite often that they were given their predictions on financial institutions .
maybe my father was listening to me evening evening .
so i left them in silence -- but properly , and i had to be a .
i eventually figured out a pyramid , but i &apos;m missing the time to go more carefully .
although you lose not afraid to have failure , if we have given everything to be , because who can give more than to give you what he &apos;s doing .
if i call it names , i never know an answer .
did i have enough <unk> ?
the second challenge is cells .
today , in many clinical trials , different kinds of stem cells are used to heart disease .
it &apos;s only last month we &apos;ve succeeded with this technology to show the human genome project .
we can map them together and turn them to turn 360 degrees , and then analyze the kidney in all their <unk> properties , and then we can just take that information and scan it by print .
i couldn &apos;t regularly go to school . i was just dirty .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yes , i want . i want this operation .
you may have noticed that a new area called the <unk> is called the <unk> .
and connected with this <unk> , there were examples around the world -- from the choice of an president to the <unk> wikipedia , and everything lies between -- the showed what the power of a crowd could achieve .
third , <unk> , <unk> environmental issues .
because what you need is this is the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want cd , i want the music she plays .
my name is joseph and i a a member of kenya .
we need to <unk> our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve infrastructure .
late at night i was driving batteries and ice .
together , anybody <unk> ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , give the master &apos;s master and work in full-time , to make it happen .
it can be huge spending , but if the city can win a number of x volunteers for y hours , the average of the <unk> labor is the city of the city .
they have <unk> , tables and data .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been going to do in the 18 minutes that have been given to talk to here between two and <unk> people who are going to be traveled into cities .
and he was in a <unk> <unk> mud .
the buildings here have several stories .
these green things in the foreground are mangoes .
and if you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , you have a political activity at once .
i couldn &apos;t know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would let this dream true .
think about it . these men who didn &apos;t have the same <unk> as i did , helped me get my <unk> support , <unk> <unk> .
at the time , <unk> was working on a <unk> , but by using a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , he could develop a machine that could read any <unk> .
but you know , i find it very lonely to read from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books over the border , in the different english-speaking countries , different versions of the world : britain , usa , canada , australia , and new zealand had to have all sorts of harry potter .
the <unk> . it has been doubling since <unk> , and it has been increasing steadily with a speed of five hours a day .
one last thing . do you wish people like me , ok ?
second , the new machine machine is a good news , because once the androids are taking over , we don &apos;t have to do these anymore , and we &apos;ve got <unk> <unk> .
the societal challenges are being considered to be considered by this disparity .
the economic playbook is surprisingly clear , and surprisingly , , especially in short , very short .
and my biggest concern is that we &apos;re creating a world with <unk> technologies , embedded in a slightly more livable society and <unk> through an economy that inequality has to make .
and over the course of the years , i was increasingly ambivalent with this notion of god .
some people have <unk> that we can only believe in a god who divides our pain .
the second <unk> comes the line , &quot; wind and waves obey him . &quot;
so who is god , if not the big <unk> or <unk> ?
the <unk> soul of the universe .
by seeking the god inside , by looking at my own <unk> .
so , one of the first things i started studying was the story of the <unk> .
we &apos;ve found no <unk> of twins that were over than 40 years , and the average age of these hunter-gatherer and ancient tribes is 20 to 30 .
our bodies have used to these new diet .
so this equality of energy and matter that einstein showed , and the modern science of <unk> shows the entropy and information and matter and energy and energy all connected together , so it &apos;s a long continuum .
this is a robot that wants to hack its own plug to get more electricity .
and what i mean by that is that we &apos;re looking for a new job .
a great evolution that started billions of years ago is moving through us and continues . and our choice is in fact , lies in the technology , is really in the way that we have more powerful than ourselves .
and they said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got 30 to five classes in 30 to 40 students .
we put this down down , and we found beautiful <unk> , <unk> bars , and it had this -- while we said , &quot; you know what , it looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
so we waited , we sat down the tables and we waited waiting for .
there are many <unk> . the only problem , especially for adults , for the adults who were working on , they didn &apos;t really know when they started , that there was only a toilet .
the teachers we work with -- everything is different from teachers -- they tell us what to do .
about 170 tutors with you in the book , and so this works a wonderful thing .
and right behind -- there is usually a little chain -- just behind it , they saw kids teaching kids .
there &apos;s this <unk> -- it &apos;s a shelf that you don &apos;t see when you &apos;re in in in , but it opens up slowly .
he &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s his his cousin .
write him an email , he &apos;ll ask you every question that you can imagine .
i was this girl .
eighty percent of refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s one side that thinks that peace means the end of the struggle , and there &apos;s one side that thinks peace is the creation of schools and jobs .
she sent her kids to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s one thing that means , &quot; manual for complete idiots , &quot; you know that ?
on cape cod there are <unk> roads , and we all can drive here .
that &apos;s my baby <unk> . thank you very much .
he basically said , &quot; i designed everything . &quot;
and in a sense , i always felt bad about this .
so i encountered this kind of complications .
i found out that cheetos are very good <unk> .
the university of college is most difficult , so number 10 is difficult .
from all , in a strange <unk> of <unk> , about a window to the moment that the road was black in front of my house , and this <unk> <unk> there was <unk> in the sun .
and i was reminded by the great presentation by karen armstrong reminds me that religion has really understood nothing to believe , but has to do with behavior .
the <unk> has seen geographically , the same size , but it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it &apos;s exactly the same size as the united states , <unk> of a field that is about the same size as the state of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the developing world .
we can &apos;t wait for the <unk> that australia had to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our whole civilization .
so a new appreciation of the design that we own through the premise of this challenge .
so before i show you some pictures of the preview , i &apos;d like to point out on this beautiful detail about <unk> and design .
rca , in this sense , is really an extraordinary school .
we &apos;ve discussed with keith <unk> &apos;s morning with keith <unk> , many scientists tend to be able to show something beautiful in their talks , fear of being seen as dumb <unk> .
here &apos;s a examples of you can actually print in 3d , which is very interesting .
so that &apos;s what makes us think more about what robot means for us .
no . so i had to think a little sharper .
we did the same for iraq .
that was a challenge we had to be as physicists .
we can press it . the forces are more . there are more of them , but they &apos;re weaker .
&quot; <unk> 7 &quot; <unk> a whole band
and there are a few employees in foundations called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the idea of justice that shows our lives and gives us a sense of what is right in life is what &apos;s in life , what we should do , social justice .
and as this is , he <unk> himself during the <unk> .
every week , the <unk> would come up , &quot; god , you &apos;ve got me back again . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , an infection , a inflammation or an operation .
muscles were evident , paralyzed -- <unk> like this .
we &apos;re treating them with <unk> drugs -- <unk> -- who are frankly frankly , in this kind of pain , are not very effective .
now , you get a sense of how much rock we &apos;re talking about here .
it was 1908 . don &apos;t do anything . i can live .
i don &apos;t know if you can see it from the back of the back , and that &apos;s just stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called deep impact , which one -- which led to a part of the in the core of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , i said , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we can have a <unk> and vote , and therefore we can change our future .
at that time i led to <unk> , the only independent , to be precise , the only electronic medium of the country .
and i thought that <unk> survival and a great business would be if <unk> was just gone , what turned out to be right .
and by the end of the meeting , he says , look , it &apos;s not going to work , you never see your money , but my foundation will put 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said , this -- that &apos;s okay , let &apos;s get you to get your business plan , what actually did .
you see , we &apos;ve started in both and <unk> with our work , and we went to russia .
after a while , we opened a <unk> .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea of harnessing bonds , <unk> out of the free press .
and in this way , you organize the funding , so that there are no <unk> , no blind ones , to find themselves .
so , why is this going to work ? that &apos;s the question .
well , some of you call it a theory of everything .
and one example is this : newton found the law of gravity , which works like one divided through the square of the helicopter between the each other .
the more symmetry you have , the better you make the simplicity and elegance of theory theory .
one thing he thought of most of us today is , but at the time , it was not of course .
it doesn &apos;t mean the meaning of this environmental system that they follow <unk> laws , and accidents .
but he was reading in every free moment that he had , books .
powered from this ambition , he returned to the <unk> .
but when he was doing his signature under the <unk> , his hand was deaf and <unk> , because he had a thousand hands on the morning of a <unk> .
not surprisingly , it was just three women under the 16 <unk> in the white house .
but i have to say , the older i became , the more i understand what an incredible privilege was to have with this aging lion from a man so many hours .
and so , lincoln the story , all after the war went to the u.k.
i asked my father , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
and the reason why i always grateful for this strange love for this strange love is the story that allows me to spend a life on the past .
he had the temple <unk> and <unk> .
this is the <unk> , this object is the evidence that the jews after exile was in babylon , after all the years they sat in the rivers , and in the memory of jerusalem , that these jews were allowed to go home .
all of these are being respected by cyrus .
the <unk> cylinder is from the <unk> of the great <unk> of babylon , marduk .
you all know what happened .
so , to see this object in tehran , thousands of iran were living to tehran .
some know more about the circumstances of living , but they still think they &apos;re a miserable evil .
the newly <unk> babies were in the first few hours , but their needs were not satisfied , and eventually they learned to be no longer to try , and within a few days , they were <unk> , <unk> and starting to the air like everybody else .
one study shows that 10 percent of a price cost cost of cost costs , whereas <unk> costs about 30 percent .
and that fascinated me , because i almost almost spent my whole life in front of a camera .
you &apos;re quite quickly know what you have to do to find an answer .
there were <unk> people there -- most of them -- most of them and family .
we heard every single person .
but of course , he never came . the explanation never happened .
and after many , many meetings , i was thrilled that this man , <unk> <unk> , really one of my heroes and mentors , managed to get unicef on the boat .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed in peace and their possibilities , etc . , etc . , and they were actually going to get it .
we connect with <unk> -- i met <unk> <unk> , and i said , &quot; at london 2012 , it &apos;s about the truce .
it &apos;s about your <unk> to your business .
the biggest brains in the world should also be the cognitively popular .
i <unk> the literature after the number of noise , but i never could .
there &apos;s just a big <unk> .
and amazingly , that exactly matches what our ancestors would have invented a a a a million years ago when they were cooking cooking .
just simple simple methodology for the conversations i led .
and i think i &apos;m just at the beginning .
but once the fighting fights , the physical rehabilitation was exposed .
behind him was a kid , his son , red in the face of a effort to <unk> his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
and i was talking to my bosses at the evening , and i told them -- i &apos;m going to -- i &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; look , we start a day , just for a few hours . &quot;
two groups of the school started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
&quot; yet , we need to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
<unk> , not just in the orthopedic center , but in the houses of the people .
and you should see me during a <unk> .
and this hospital could have been able to afford .
why ? because the way i had taken it was banned .
but i learned something more striking than that , which is that the leaders -- the managers of the economy -- were really bad decisions that made our economy just before the collapse .
because i knew that the state of the african continent would be the way to my children and their children .
i &apos;m trying to get the experience that i had in swarthmore to bring to africa .
is my time ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment from a great society can grow within a generation .
you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s a very <unk> ball , the sun that we draw as children .
in fact , that &apos;s something that half of them , is not being familiar with half .
32 cod <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
probably . &quot;
and these are the messages that you &apos;re them ?
because , in the bottom , the sponsors love it , and so it &apos;s constantly going on on tv .
a professional <unk> talking to dead , doesn &apos;t it get me ?
what is <unk> ?
we &apos;d like to give you a few of people how to make <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , so they do something .
thank you .
so that &apos;s why the entire hospital is often running over a generator .
there must be something better . &quot;
but that &apos;s how the user can control whether it &apos;s current , whether it &apos;s electricity , because you can control the <unk> on the ground , how much percent oxygen you give your patient .
but we want to be sure that this is the most powerful and safe device that we can provide to hospitals .
the different species of writing in africa , the first one was <unk> , the script <unk> , which is the <unk> of a secret company of the <unk> in <unk> .
anyway , until 1998 , when a <unk> named john <unk> <unk> in the <unk> at <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in 1800 , in b.c.
almost one fifth of all greenhouse gases comes from the greenhouse -- that &apos;s more than the traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the animals to <unk> animals and animals animals like tools , not just order .
<unk> was a pure french .
a picture of <unk> would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t really bad .
i &apos;ll ask you a question .
some of us would think that this might not be that bad at all .
about a year ago , i asked myself a question : &quot; why am i , although i know what i know , no vegetarian ? &quot;
on weekend you have choice .
you can make a picture with a iphone and all the names , even though it &apos;s even mistakes .
it &apos;s distracted . he finally won the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would think it was be interest to find out if the stakes are so high , but it &apos;s a very <unk> area .
or a aesthetic experience -- a <unk> or a big artwork .
human nature has to change .
but part of the reason -- and this is why we have a ethical level in the conscious point of what we &apos;ve been -- is that they &apos;re also valuable .
it could be more complicated to people , but maybe not very .
jh : is it <unk> to play with these forces ?
and so i knew i had a little to use .
so there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s the dynamic behavior of the liquid .
and so i think they can be <unk> .
this is a great <unk> in the studio .
we take the pizza , we &apos;re our first pizza , and we put the individual slices , during the front of the hallway , we &apos;re <unk> and we &apos;re <unk> .
i was safe 20 , before i first went into art museum .
i thought , okay , you &apos;ve got some criteria how you want to choose the works .
it &apos;s not a photoshop .
they were interested in creating alternative <unk> , and they needed money for it , so they decided to make some interesting projects .
this project is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so we went to the grave and did this , it was extraordinary -- the attention we got .
and it describes how the <unk> -- all they say is like because of the <unk> fruit .
he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it &apos;s on origami . so , go .
people are understanding mathematical principles to the art of the underlying principles .
or they &apos;ll take it to the top , and they &apos;ll go 50 stars to a flag with 13 feet .
how would you make a single flap ?
we &apos;ve found these rules that you &apos;re going to represent circles , you &apos;re covering the <unk> with lines that obey additional rules , which makes the crease pattern .
you can do a lot of things .
but if you want to make it bigger , you might need something origami .
and it doesn &apos;t matter whether you go into space or you &apos;re going to go into a body .
i grew up in a <unk> in the state of washington with a much time time .
we only have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about it hours .
and so i want to talk about this because if we don &apos;t recognize it , this transformation will be very painful .
and in a moment i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the chart -- it starts in 1973 , just before the women start to <unk> the job job , and it goes on to the day .
you gave instruction from top .
because i &apos;m writing about all this , i &apos;m still going to do it , and i don &apos;t have any answer .
and that was very disheartening for them .
because we haven &apos;t completely processed this information , come back to us in the form of pop culture , in this weird and overblown way , where you can see that changing .
there is no man or woman who stands in the middle and is to <unk> the cables .
when you have your own income on a scale that was given to be constant to consider inflation , in that time , more than doubled , almost tripled .
and to hear and understand what i say , you already need about 60 bits per second .
it &apos;s still going to happen , so in the last book of me called &quot; good business , &quot; i interviewed some ceo who are very successful and very successful at the same time , with great social practices .
control is always a safe thing , because you feel inside you , but not very much .
&quot; where are you born , grew up and school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own meaning of what home is . they had their sense of community , and even for hostility , which was handed them from birth to them , they didn &apos;t really have the opportunity to go beyond it .
more and more people are also as well as as in the past , as we are in the past .
i went down to the room where i should sleep .
<unk> <unk> : where is you home ?
there was a huge gap between one billion in the industrialized countries and the two billion in the developing world .
but that &apos;s the world we have today . no gap anymore .
and let me show you why by using the <unk> technology technology .
the children &apos;s survival is the new green .
and again , they were better than we : &quot; your brits and your mortality is <unk> . &quot;
but if you give people <unk> , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i started working immediately with <unk> , and i &apos;d growing them , and then worked with <unk> , mice that could not produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my mother-in-law , and of course i don &apos;t know how old she is .
if you could be as good at the equator in summer .
certainly many advances , many <unk> lives .
this is actually real photography , at the time lapse , showing that the <unk> is going to be in less days .
and on the right , you see what happened six months later , which is technically <unk> .
a <unk> is made of two different cell types .
then , put it back into this oven-like device .
much more complex organs . with distance the most complex solid organs , the very complex organs , are high , with any amount of <unk> organs like heart , liver and kidneys .
this is still in the <unk> .
we prefer cells that are not reject , and we don &apos;t form tumors .
we only need five seconds .
for every problem there , anybody would have an idea .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m just in panic -- unlike all the caffeine and sugar that i had -- but this is really creepy for an entrepreneur .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to visit a <unk> .
i went from door to door and sold .
it &apos;s like a recession . so , there &apos;s a recession .
and you would do these chairs .
that &apos;s pointless . &quot; you have to find a way to get money faster .
i sold a lot of <unk> .
they don &apos;t get any regular income , but they have the ability to find more tasks and learn to understand the ability to model , and they also learn the ability to find more possibilities .
if you go to a restaurant and you &apos;re going to get bad , you show them how bad it looks like .
these boys , locust .
so the development of today &apos;s students is to throw all the interests except for one .
the <unk> of <unk> or a <unk> of cultural <unk> deprive the most of our students .
the other of the past are also <unk> . it &apos;s a lot of society .
but it &apos;s a policy of principles , not the <unk> .
they have a mind . and they have other people .
what we should be thinking about when we think about conservatives -- except this case of the <unk> -- -- what &apos;s going on is this : they go to church .
sure , i know you don &apos;t really believe it .
and that &apos;s not just leads to another outcome , it has the potential to change how we deal with each other .
totally different .
actually , that &apos;s not a proper organization , but clearly -- let me conclude -- creative commons offers a simple way to put your content with the freedoms that you want them to leave .
john mccain .
and i wonder how many times this happens .
he told me that he was going to <unk> the <unk> , and then there said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re going to get <unk> here . &quot;
so for this i had the idea that i was running them through this process and showing you what this journey looks like .
and the hospital and general electric was also happy .
i survived , just to get us right .
i &apos;m always asking by people , &quot; is it really possible to use these microbial ecosystems to our advantage ? &quot;
another way of spreading microbes is through the people . architects like to <unk> spaces like this , to connect the human interaction or the exchange of ideas in such a way , in the order of the ideas of the ideas in the city of the .
imagine a design that takes microbes , like , in the airplane or on a telephone .
and nobody knew about it .
my company , <unk> , built a system called <unk> for the apple macintosh .
in 1992 , his essay was rejected by the <unk> .
and greenpeace wanted to do the <unk> , and a method that wanted to do was to put one of these humpback whales in the field of one of these humpback whales .
on 78 percent of the voices , to give you an idea of the <unk> defeat : the two in the <unk> , only three percent .
and the last message i want to tell you about is , you can be pretty successful online .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what a great privilege is to stand today .
this is the school built with the community .
one thing we have in gando is <unk> .
just like that .
good morning . magic is a great way to predict the <unk> , to make this possible , that the science will really be tomorrow .
there &apos;s the color red red red , and the color black , they &apos;re the <unk> of day .
voice : why not ? that &apos;s a very good piece .
this is an illusion .
so this is china , a civilization-state , not so much a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t do a country like china , on the basis of a civilization , a system .
and the reason is , first , the state in china gets a very special -- -- a very special relative to the <unk> , the embodiment , the <unk> of chinese civilization , the <unk> .
he was in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> with <unk> and shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the <unk> -- which is the position of the <unk> rapidly -- or the <unk> .
he &apos;s going to go down a road on the road , and the cars are below .
red blue = <unk> blue = <unk> green = <unk> orange = <unk> = <unk> = <unk> .
and the first song was in english , the second one was in chinese .
she was standing her song .
i made graffiti , and i wrote my name everywhere , using the city as a canvas .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
they all agreed that their picture would be next to each other .
&quot; you mean , you &apos;re wearing a <unk> face -- that &apos;s a fake , right ? &quot;
most places i went to go to , decided to go to the media of i had heard about them .
i took more photos , and we started this project .
are you an ngo ? are you from the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were <unk> , a woman said , &quot; now god can see me . &quot;
because this is a big part of it . there &apos;s layers behind each picture .
but basically they had a promise to me .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
when i think about the mesh and and what it makes it to me , what &apos;s happening now , i think there are some factors that i want to give you as a <unk> .
they have caused a trend .
zipcar started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
it &apos;s to participation . cities have been in the <unk> of participation in the far .
it &apos;s very inexpensive , and it &apos;s very , very <unk> .
the last 40 years was extraordinary times .
and also miniaturization .
that would be a huge <unk> .
it &apos;s vital that at ted <unk> ideas , ideas that we think of , are forward forward and make sure that this is going to be a particularly popular century , not one of the most <unk> and <unk> .
my remaining family are boring academics , who are engaging in collecting <unk> from the <unk> for our <unk> .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he was crazy , but something that really resonated with it .
i was sitting , like you , in the audience .
this is another picture .
my career since netra , i was a lot of success .
i began exploring the <unk> <unk> of the human psyche .
this time , i said , let &apos;s try something else .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein is very honored to be here at ted 2006 between all the world &apos;s today , and in fact , it &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous if you were running down .
sw : no , i don &apos;t have a problem . you have the problem , remember ?
sw : big finish .
sw : what about a <unk> ?
my parents were very important for their internal serenity .
if i have a talent , it &apos;s kind of <unk> apart from which i have <unk> .
the body has higher density than the water , at least 95 percent of the body &apos;s body , under itself .
and this will bring them very far .
i asked him what that means .
at that point , if you want to , you know , you can take a lot of languages and you can take them out without any other .
and she looked up to me and said , &quot; well , that &apos;s just better . &quot;
i think they &apos;re agree with me that they look very good together .
and so , you know , we &apos;ve done tests of 50,000 students , , , , about half a dozen schools , my readers , by the way .
we found -- and we were wrong with a lot of things and then we made them -- but we found that the young people loved it .
<unk> <unk> : a small primer into the <unk>
and finally , the only person who is a , a young shepherd , and he goes to saul and he goes , &quot; i &apos;m going to fight him . &quot;
there &apos;s the cavalry , men on horses and with <unk> .
goliath is mild prey . he &apos;s got no chance .
so goliath is about times larger than <unk> at the time , and usually there is a explanation for someone to be far outside of norm .
and i think that it &apos;s a very important lesson in all of us .
and it turns out we &apos;re covered by a <unk> , and these microbes usually do us well instead of killing us .
they &apos;ve all all the microbes around and then the ileum inserted into the receiver .
most of the pills , or the <unk> that you can eat , contain one or two , maybe five species , and the human community has thousands of species .
we need a <unk> for the microbes that live in and in people so that we can understand what makes them our lives .
very many people think about the internet , very on english , but for us , it &apos;s truly global . we have a lot of languages .
when you saw him a ridiculous change on the side of me , she probably thought that all this was just going to be in <unk> .
it &apos;s a social concept of cooperation , so we &apos;re not talking about much about truth and objectivity .
and we have 40 <unk> , 40 <unk> .
it &apos;s not a perfect rule , but it &apos;s enough to start .
and i always like to say that she &apos;s the only person who actually knows all the rules of wikipedia , that &apos;s why ...
it seems to me that most textbooks that are used to training our children is nature , by biased .
in the jungle of guatemala , in <unk> , there &apos;s a temple .
a <unk> indian indian indian indian in <unk> , they said a missionary in <unk> , and here it is .
it &apos;s far under your cognitive <unk> .
we found activity in other <unk> -- in <unk> that are associated with the computation of profit and loss .
i have a friend who just <unk> a horrible <unk> .
and i said , i don &apos;t know .
we turn to each other , and we think our glances , and we talk .
tools like <unk> , knife , <unk> , <unk> , i had put into a towel .
i had been looking for long and wide , but never looked for me .
in some low-fat parts , they &apos;re building tools , like sponges , to <unk> .
so dolphins can <unk> and accumulate out of distance .
look at the way you synchronize with your partner and the other <unk> .
but what we found is that free dolphins wouldn &apos;t just go on a boat like this on a keyboard .
this dolphin called we called &quot; <unk> , &quot; because she &apos;s about 12 years of <unk> .
but as we decode their natural sounds , we also want to bring it back to the building system .
and the word is invented .
there &apos;s yves rossy .
and especially if you &apos;re in the <unk> , you &apos;re going to be able to fly .
yr : i &apos;m just trying to be fit .
i &apos;ve been using this for the last 15 years -- never with this kind of wing , but at the beginning .
we don &apos;t say that to their employer .
but it was up to <unk> and full of <unk> .
and you know , you &apos;ve seen , , you know , what you saw , you could explain with the invisible powers .
because this event was the scientific revolution since which our knowledge of the physical world , how we can adapt to our needs , is <unk> in the growing .
by the way , why don &apos;t we do that ?
it &apos;s based on assumptions ; our on the bible . &quot;
there &apos;s something like a <unk> story .
and only if one explanation is good , it &apos;s also important that you can check them .
glasses are not very expensive . there &apos;s pretty abundant .
it &apos;s about 30,000 of them at the moment .
what &apos;s minto about a place ?
the new festival is asking the audience to play a vital role in the performance performance performance .
she had met with other people , &quot; the sultan &apos;s elephant &quot; and that &apos;s what it was done again . &quot;
&quot; no <unk> , that &apos;s good . &quot; doctor : is you dizzy ? &quot;
i thought my career was over .
this is a bear i was sitting on the rock a while .
this is a piece of <unk> ice , it &apos;s 12 years old .
i &apos;m going to show you images of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and leopard seals , but this picture here is more than any other i &apos;ve ever done .
people were like , &quot; we knew they were malignant . we knew it . &quot;
and that seal took the penguin and he <unk> him and forth .
she walked away , started a penguin .
she tried to <unk> my camera , which is the dream of every photographer .
paul <unk> : stories from a <unk> <unk>
open your eyes now .
do you have a ring ?
you &apos;re going to focus on this task .
joe , we &apos;re doing it as long as you get it together .
funny , yes , we have a little man , a <unk> , all day up there .
as i said , she shapes her reality .
first of all , we worked together creating ushahidi and developing ushahidi .
a call in the u.s. , after canada or china costs five <unk> , or <unk> u.s. dollars .
it &apos;s built up , so that you can also join a <unk> and also put in remote remote places .
and over time , the buildings were getting higher and bigger our technology was getting more , so that the mechanical systems were enormous . they need tremendous amounts of energy .
imagine two americans travel through italy .
please raise your mind as a liberal agent .
the best definition of <unk> &apos; that i know -- she explains so much -- comes from <unk> &apos;s <unk> marcus .
he makes us very , very old <unk> .
but look at the other three lines .
isn &apos;t that just the foundations of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> ?
it went upward and over and over and over .
and they say , &quot; hold your laws away from my body . &quot;
and we have the markings of <unk> to the right , <unk> is the liberals god -- and both of them work together .
and so the answer , i think , is to use these passionate commitment to truth and try to turn them into a better future for all of us .
but if you react to a lot of other people in the environment that are innocent , but they might be hurt -- the military doesn &apos;t like to talk about <unk> .
we look at something else , &quot; and clearly don &apos;t seem to realize that the situations were really very comparable .
is someone giving a commandment , how often do you think it was introduced , how often the police in queensland were in the humanoid store ?
there were just a few people shot in this incident .
it &apos;s 72 and it looks like this is the most consistent way that dealing with it .
and when you &apos;re to use them , people will give up , but it shouldn &apos;t be any damage to any damage . &quot;
we have started makers in our maker <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> billy bass , something like that .
and i &apos;ll tell you more about it , but ...
but he also moved here to other people who did the same as he did .
this is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and we have to bring that into schools , or to communities to many , many ways -- the ability to force the world to shape and redefine the world .
there &apos;s glamour glamour .
and indeed , we see these <unk> photos of stars all the time -- they &apos;re called them .
they &apos;re not going to be about one way , but you have to mentally surrender their world .
so , <unk> , <unk> , glamorous .
but it will always gives you the illusion that if you buy this lamp , you can then live in a world without cords .
the perfect <unk> -- symbolized by the perfect chain with the perfect <unk> .
because glamour can be very <unk> and deceptively .
but i also knew how hard they did all the week work .
i did this before many strangers .
i heard of women being harassed in their beds , or <unk> in their dorm rooms , as dead left left on parking sections , with acid acid in their kitchens .
then i got cancer -- or i found that i had cancer .
my friend was making this big bowl , and i asked her , &quot; what &apos;s that ? &quot;
it was a friends and a friends , friends and a quiet sister .
because we &apos;re all so badly <unk> to imagine our inner experience of our peers and intentions their secret intentions . &quot;
children need a long time to make the system .
rs : <unk> . -- now we go to joshua to get a drink .
rs : should ivan get the trouble ?
and she &apos;s in the coffee of her friend .
so first of all , i &apos;m going to show you that it &apos;s a <unk> .
please tell me that you don &apos;t <unk> , if you say , the pentagon is going to be doing this .
but why do you even have to feel something ?
and it was , you know , you probably thought of it , a course of <unk> .
and second , is it possible to slow down or even <unk> ?
they want to go back to a slow rhythm .
and norway , sweden , denmark and finland are under the six <unk> nations in the world and work hours of the average american would be before .
but the new idea , the revolutionary idea of the <unk> is that there &apos;s also something like good slow .
i &apos;m stuck , the <unk> of a <unk> task on my <unk> , and it was <unk> me before you , because they were so slow and wanted to be finished .
and so everything took off , and they said , &quot; you can &apos;t build everything on an island ; part of them has to stay on the shore because we don &apos;t want to go from the community . &quot;
i worked on months of work , and i didn &apos;t get it because i felt that people who came from the historical museum already had information , and when they see a museum with information , they would not be able to process that .
when i flew home , the <unk> was planned .
but you can see the uniqueness of the environment .
moshe <unk> : the building on the uniqueness
and if christian plays a note -- play , for example , a f.
so in jazz , the <unk> is absolutely amazing .
it &apos;s not about my vision of <unk> or something .
am i interested ? do i exist for you ?
they had to get a lot of <unk> to come here .
in the summer , india warms up , it &apos;s extremely hot .
and the adult animal that comes after that , lives another or two months .
i didn &apos;t know that at that time , but i know it today . these are hundreds of <unk> .
i was a little curious . i &apos;ll just stop because i want to ask you . and here &apos;s a lot of people who -- from india , of course , people who spent their childhood here .
so next i was going to the phone .
october , november , december , december . that &apos;s not the time of the northeast monsoon .
okay , you put your eggs at the time of the <unk> rains during the time of the <unk> .
it &apos;s just last week , it &apos;s <unk> . the <unk> have started , and now it &apos;s raining .
a pretty incredible <unk> .
incredible . this is the <unk> of of a <unk> , a pretty incredible migrations .
i made this from my life .
and everybody thought , i &apos;d be good . but in the new way , i was terrible . people were like , &quot; oh , he &apos;s -- oh , what happened to cafeterias ? &quot;
and the night before i was doing surgery , i looked at them and i said , &quot; how am i going to do this ? &quot;
next -- oh , look . these guys are the community .
so i was pretty successful . and if you &apos;ve done all this , what is it that you &apos;ll make you do ? i &apos;ve talked about the <unk> and other things , but what does you make ?
in my last tedtalk , about seven years ago .
but carl norden really cracked the code .
whenever the norden bombsight is brought into a plane , it will accompanied by a series of <unk> <unk> .
the plant plant was moving over three square kilometers .
after the war was over , there was a review -- like the army , the force force , and they asked the question : how many <unk> did we actually destroyed ?
i described to you the opposite of a success story .
a walk in a city or a walk , this is a kind of a of the diversity of human species .
we ask about the human ancestry .
but what data is the <unk> ?
imagine you &apos;d have to do that .
it was a african that &apos;s been based on the global diversity of the world &apos;s population .
the sahara was much bigger than today .
the people who were approaching the killing animals that they were moving down into the <unk> , moved north and after about 45,000 years ago , the grasslands in the middle east in a rare <unk> phase of the sahara desert .
the <unk> , <unk> on mars .
we know deep in our hearts that the universe is not moving from mush to complexity .
so there we go .
what you see here , the blue areas are about a thousandth of the range of light than the red areas .
that &apos;s the more than gravity , which explains why you and i &apos;m smaller than the stars and planets .
you &apos;re going to be familiar with the double helix of dna .
let me explain why .
in the last 200 years , something else happened .
now , you might ask yourself , &quot; what &apos;s the talk about ? &quot;
we &apos;re not so good when it &apos;s about insurance insurance .
and then you have to decide how you invest in your 52 choices , and you &apos;ve never heard of a <unk> .
at least a wonderful study has predicted .
but if you get the driver &apos;s license , you &apos;re the box if you don &apos;t want to donate the organs .
the other group gets two apples , one is taken .
save more tomorrow just makes it .
this is just one example .
it &apos;s a song about a <unk> , a creature that mimics a creature , which creates a creature .
hello , who is that , please ?
thank you .
that &apos;s too much impact on the <unk> .
i &apos;m trying to <unk> time .
so what did i do ?
we invent stories to explain our existence .
so what did they do ? they sent their walter raleigh to separate their human part of their divine part .
do you have a child ?
elizabeth : <unk> out ! yell out ! get out !
i went to visit a friend of mine , and he was waiting for me in his <unk> hill in the 20th floor , a really rich area in mumbai .
everything is a contradiction .
we lived from less than one dollar a day -- about 15 years .
and you &apos;ve got to use nuts from the grains to show that forests are worth more than than <unk> . &quot;
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t <unk> a person who &apos;s going to sleep . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about people ; it &apos;s about <unk> .
if on a limited planet , if all the planet should be sustainable , how can we achieve this ?
coke has to work with diet .
these are nine of them .
and at the end , i think 60 percent of the world &apos;s production is at table and 25 percent of the gdp .
it &apos;s not irrelevant .
but they don &apos;t just buy the juice ; they also buy the carbon in the trees , to offset the <unk> of the <unk> that are coming to the <unk> of the product to europe .
so the communication of between brain and spinal cord is interrupted ; it leads to a complete and sustained paralysis of the <unk> .
after a few years , we &apos;ve managed to develop an electrochemical <unk> that <unk> the nervous system of the spinal cord in a <unk> state .
we &apos;ve been working on to do this for 10 years .
after a few weeks of recovery , we put a programmable pump to inject a individual diagnostic directly into the spinal cord .
and i was a kid of the working-class team .
he talked about the world , as it is , &quot; and the world as it ought to be . &quot;
and by doing that , the women , these women , they <unk> out obstacles .
in the white house , and the desk he sits on , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and the day , the woman who stood up there was all about everything , and we talked about each other , and suddenly she said to me , &quot; would you sing me ? &quot;
for this , this <unk> is a <unk> to the voice , because it &apos;s mysterious -- as you can see -- it &apos;s completely spontaneously , and it &apos;s originally .
they didn &apos;t have that .
so the internet needs <unk> and orders .
one of the most popular websites in the world , which is run by the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing that youtube or google could have to do .
and today wikipedia is so <unk> that you can even find them on the maps of restaurants in china .
and that &apos;s what wikipedia understood .
so this is a blog that <unk> <unk> .
why ? there &apos;s a <unk> at <unk>
the world didn &apos;t end in the &apos; 90s .
and we see that the impact of the impact in some countries is very , very strong .
all of this costs money .
and it was a lot of time to give students with <unk> or social , among socially weak families .
how are schools and teachers are in the media ?
in the <unk> , teachers are <unk> in classes alone and they have to have a lot of <unk> .
some people claim that the change of the <unk> is a <unk> .
but if you look at the problem from this perspective , then you see what &apos;s happened in the last 60 years .
and i walked around the morning about 15 kilometers to get to the <unk> .
so this was obviously a <unk> device .
we could do that with phones .
so , a business is for you .
&quot; government must offer economically <unk> services . &quot;
it was once , long , long ago , when i was 24 years old , and i was at st. john &apos;s college in bangalore .
and you can see my map when i &apos;m going to <unk> you here .
i also bring an invention .
now we &apos;re in the 1930s , and you can see that japan is going through a period of war , with lower life expectancy .
and they decided not to invest not only in health and education , but started making economies grow .
washington , d.c. , went outside .
not the bubble , not my bubbles , but the financial bubble .
are they going to really accept rich countries a completely global economy , and the power of where they were in the last 50 to 150 years was back to asia ?
the rest of the diagram is a very mysterious substance called dark energy .
but it doesn &apos;t explain the whole of all the mass .
and now , paying attention to the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe -- three-dimensional space .
again : this is a kind of <unk> model of what &apos;s going on during the design project .
they move away from each other , because the room is getting bigger .
looking at things like clusters -- their <unk> , how many of you are as a function of time -- can we can in experience in which dark matter and dark energy are in the competition to form structures .
the big questions in physics .
sleepy you banjo boys : <unk> bluegrass ? new jersey ?
so , recycling and reusing are <unk> here .
marc <unk> : a million reasons to reinvent the <unk>
and in fact , there was this change in gay men in the u.s. states .
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa , and many children .
in uganda , we see the spread .
so it &apos;s based on pretty similar modes of sound .
but openness and connection has a price when we think of disease . it shouldn &apos;t be a surprise .
coffee is <unk> <unk> .
emily <unk> studies , again , the aids statistics in africa from a economic perspective , comes to a surprising conclusion : all our knowledge about spreading hiv from hiv on continent continent is wrong .
but i was fascinated by this , because i watched this kind of <unk> italian <unk> .
he was called &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; called the <unk> , because he was <unk> in the front , but every time he walked into a tunnel , he built a <unk> . he had a <unk> in the tunnel , and then there was a kind of a <unk> .
these are the <unk> that the water is like a magnet .
and then we ask ourselves why the membrane is going to be and why it &apos;s so much power to do .
for example , in the <unk> of <unk> into a material .
in <unk> <unk> , my <unk> , we collaborated with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
janine benyus : biomimicry in using
&quot; yes , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not one , and fortunately , no young .
you can &apos;t do anything about it .
it never happened in india , because that &apos;s once and never again .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
this was a <unk> for over 1,000 inmates in this prison .
second , it &apos;s about the <unk> movement in india .
let me tell you about a project that we did a few years later , a kind of a design of captcha .
basically , you do it by starting with an old book .
the number of pages the recaptcha is actually so high that the number of words we &apos;re heading a day very , very large .
some are more fun .
now , the web is divided into multiple languages .
then my my my my my <unk> .
there &apos;s a way of getting two flies to a valve .
but what &apos;s even more surprising , the translations that we get from the <unk> , even if they &apos;re just <unk> , the translations that we get are also as much as the professional <unk> , and that &apos;s very surprising .
as you learn value , you don &apos;t have to pay for money , you pay for your time .
the <unk> side , the company , makes what she really good at .
<unk> to the active participation is everything else than normal .
and zipcar offers a very <unk> , <unk> service , which works .
for aristotle , happiness was the highest good thing to do everything else .
maybe these people are right . they &apos;re thinking about their thoughts , maybe not good .
10 percent of time is thoughts -- ... sex versus .
i played the violent african , the african terrorists .
now , from the first <unk> , no <unk> <unk> came out -- so it had no one to get the absolute majority -- so the election in a second round three weeks later .
so here &apos;s a interesting comparison .
so i moved to la jolla and learned surfing .
the people in the 17th century didn &apos;t really know as much as we were that this stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and we breathe it out of one reason , and that &apos;s the way we breathe .
and so , charles , i &apos;m going to give money to give you a building , and you can make you there , but please talk about religion there .
reality is what you can see .
i thought everybody would do this with a little bit .
just to see what would happen if you mix the two .
so i have something that is not personal .
if you want to get rich today , entrepreneurs will be .
they say , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it doesn &apos;t go up at all -- it doesn &apos;t work at all . we &apos;ve been very carefully at satellites for 20 years , and it doesn &apos;t go up .
biochemist kary mullis talks about the foundation of modern science : the experiment . he shares stories from the 17th century and his own <unk> in the garden and <unk> curiosity in the garden and <unk> curiosity , inspiration and care of all of its forms .
i wanted to represent a real way of a living body that <unk> this <unk> , decrepit spaces .
&quot; <unk> city &quot; is a nickname for new york and &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> the <unk> and <unk> that comes from the sense of <unk> in a urban environment .
i love traveling , and berlin , one of my favorite ones .
and all of the time i haven &apos;t seen a single rat on some of these places until recently , when i was in the london canals .
the first question is , and maybe you write them , either on a sheet of paper , physically , or on a virtual slate in your head , and for viewers home , you can try it .
and we stop , &quot; we are the best <unk> in the world , &quot; because of our british <unk> .
except that -- well , you &apos;re going -- well , in your <unk> , you thought , &quot; hmm , what &apos;s happening during the night ? &quot;
and one of the hardest issues is , if people have a idea of how everything works , it &apos;s quite hard to change this .
and as an expert for foreign chemistry , i have friends and colleagues , who are different between the organic , living world and the most vulnerable , <unk> world .
and you can see it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , growing in a way .
we even have amazing life forms that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself put in a letter to a colleagues who probably that life would probably come somewhere in a warm little pond -- maybe not in scotland , maybe in africa , perhaps somewhere else .
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can connect them and literally thousands and thousands of thousands of really large molecules , in the same size of dna and protein , but it &apos;s not carbon in view .
we want to put them into the environment , and we want them to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can make inorganic biology and bring matter to it , then it will define life .
but there &apos;s a second reason why i like these <unk> : every single one is measuring .
and these are highly professional women who sit down for an hour and ask them questions about their <unk> .
i was really sitting on the friday before my computer , and i could see how the mortality rate this morning from <unk> to 84 .
as you know , these economists love the money , they want more and more of it .
as you can see , it makes no sense a sense of a average improvement from enhancement that has none of those very rapid advances .
but you don &apos;t talk about that much .
in which there were high , or very high , child mortality , and the families were also very big , six to eight .
there &apos;s also a box .
whatever remains is more value for money .
yes , i went barefoot until i was 12 .
and he told them , &quot; well , the question of the question .
the whole time was a limit .
and <unk> , after my opinion , will make the world forward , make a difference , not just a few , but for everyone .
... above the knee knee , yes , that would be hard ...
the <unk> -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth is enough to satisfy everybody &apos;s needs , but not everybody &apos;s greed .
and <unk> die .
i went to high school .
when i was at the council of scientific research research -- 40 labs -- if two <unk> didn &apos;t speak each other , i built teams .
they &apos;ve arrived on it , and now i have apps in the app app .
it &apos;s about making something old and a old old old old .
it &apos;s still very hot , but no longer <unk> .
but because this reactor isn &apos;t under under pressure and chemically <unk> , it means that the <unk> don &apos;t tend to leave the reactor .
i believe that the reactor i &apos;ve designed here is a available source of energy that &apos;s going to be great scientific projects with electricity , and i &apos;m really willing to do that .
we move to a <unk> , where the experience is the actual product .
there &apos;s a maker who &apos;s the <unk> in case they &apos;re running in the forest .
and he finally , a long <unk> of good advice that he &apos;s serving his son , he says , &quot; especially , <unk> against yourself .
usually in los angeles , you don &apos;t go much , but here &apos;s a place where you can walk a lot out in this city .
and they &apos;re being <unk> as false , as <unk> -- by providing traits that they don &apos;t have .
when i was little , i was very introverted , and i stayed staying alone .
and then it &apos;s just starting to start at a point and build them up to the end .
so i made it made of concrete because it doesn &apos;t matter .
that was this tool .
and that &apos;s the most important thing for me , because since i was a kid , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
25 days : the <unk> developed 32 days : poor and hands are breeding days : the primitive spine begins to train these weeks , the time the fetus is developing on fastest .
the complexity that creates in a single system , again , is beyond any understanding or any understanding of math today .
because apparently there is no <unk> <unk> <unk> in the atmosphere of sun-like stars .
so what can do with these spectra ?
and recently , a colleague of berkeley , <unk> <unk> , an email with a very interesting spectrum , and said , &quot; can you see that ? &quot;
there are two ways -- over <unk> and <unk> stars -- on the matter and chemical elements in the universe and are being measured .
because can you imagine that all <unk> ?
now imagine an object , an incredible object , or something we can &apos;t explain , and we just stand up and say , &quot; we &apos;re just giving up . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and if we see <unk> , oxygen , then , i think , we have the perfect e.t. .
i just like , &quot; really ? &quot; he said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
so what i can tell you is that it &apos;s universal ; we all have it .
i &apos;m slightly hooked on <unk> , but that &apos;s another talk .
this led to a little breakdown -- which looks rather like this .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is : no <unk> , no <unk> . &quot;
what is the feeling of being vulnerable ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you don &apos;t have right . shut up .
we pretend that what we do is not a impact on other people .
people were putting their meals in twitter , the diapers of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it to use it to make systematic improvements , we think about how they might be useful to our <unk> , for our <unk> and self-awareness .
and i want to talk about one of the things we decided to do at that time , we wanted to find a new access to health .
so steven divides his story . but he &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people praying .
i also love this <unk> cochlear implant , and these were the only combs that were online and available online .
and here &apos;s another paper .
you don &apos;t have a <unk> , you have no data , that &apos;s not going to scientific methods .
this is the curve over the <unk> .
but my brother didn &apos;t go , and he went to the end .
if we went from here to the <unk> today , we would go to something that would be 300 feet long , 100 miles long , and it weighs two gigatons .
to change the state , you just have two volts of a <unk> .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can do better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that comes from the so-called <unk> .
so , networks are ideal objects complex complex systems .
and it also has a <unk> risk .
so we could get a <unk> in a <unk> .
we see the emergence of the creation and <unk> programs that are focused on understanding our connected world from the standpoint of complexity .
<unk> have a <unk> capacity with <unk> <unk> -- unless you use expensive pumps and valves .
and we had 500 of these <unk> prepared .
without human rights .
so we were on our <unk> .
and this graph is not even something that &apos;s data .
and my brain starts very quickly to think that this is a <unk> representation of <unk> to the world .
because this question requires that external world can predict our <unk> world , but the truth is that i only only 10 percent of the weight of one person , if i &apos;m going to predict the whole world world .
and this is for two reasons , scientifically , and <unk> around .
we move people when they open their <unk> , to write a positive email of the <unk> or the <unk> of somebody in their social environment .
weightfully to say -- a <unk> , you understand -- my father was the most famous man in the world .
and i went . i went to mit , i went .
they said , do it stop .
they &apos;re a huge disk of cardboard .
he was the first digital media <unk> in tokyo .
hear that ? like cows ? this is 4 o &apos;clock in logan .
so there are all these things to do , but most love i love to taste the world .
and i started this with passion .
their culture doesn &apos;t come in schools . and i want to tell you a lot of the way that we can overcome this problem .
that makes you nervous because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools where there are no boys .
and over little moments in my life .
or mothers who raised boys ?
we need to change the posture of boys in elementary school .
and you have the impression that you believe that &apos;s okay .
let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going to be .
is that a problem ? yes , big problem .
we think that these &quot; why &quot; are can give us the basic principles of nature .
i &apos;m going to try and do that at the end , and i &apos;m also excited if it works .
and it was really an important lesson for me to be really , really , to really be applied to the object .
so for example , we created a newspaper , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s connected to my ipad , and this is software that runs on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a <unk> , so i would rotate it to a <unk> , so that people in the glass of different , when you go on it .
i &apos;m going to turn from my current age , and i will turn to a middle-aged middle age , and then i &apos;ll go into an old man .
<unk> were allowed to be .
radio : what do you mean ?
just fold the wings together and drive them .
so i &apos;ll ask you another question .
and he made a royal <unk> , with <unk> , who had instruction , had to <unk> him and night and night , but with the secret instruction , not to <unk> it .
because they &apos;ve found that <unk> behaviors are the human behavior more powerful .
but yet , we have to create a <unk> <unk> , where you can create this kind of value , and it &apos;s also much more exciting .
now , if we have all these tools available , we just have to ask the question -- and thaler and <unk> did this -- how we use these smart .
they &apos;re going to lead the new <unk> .
they give a little , <unk> <unk> .
i felt , passion , soul and heart , had left my body .
audience : no .
sb : no , not , not .
there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> around us , <unk> , and we can find another replicator in this <unk> of the culture .
you probably bought them .
imagine the world of brains and more memes than space for you .
we are the only ones and the <unk> .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hey .
they use us to make the resource of the planet to produce more and more computers , and more amazing things we hear here at ted .
and will we going to bring this third danger to how we &apos;ve got the second and first ?
so , working with <unk> -- this is the <unk> in haiti -- with the ministry of public <unk> , with various <unk> , we &apos;re feeding more than 1,500 buildings .
it won &apos;t cost us to do it if we do it right . &quot;
and because i had burn 70 percent of my body , it took about an hour .
we also found that it would have been good , i would have given me to be <unk> from the pain .
and how bad would the grammar be if i was caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the <unk> people -- those who have more commandments -- have less cheated and that the less religious -- those who could not remember almost no commandments -- would have more cheated .
so if you don &apos;t think of money for a few seconds , because you &apos;re getting a brand , does that make a difference ?
because it &apos;s like this .
i think that all of these forces have very bad effects on the stock market .
but you can believe me . i work in the commercial .
these are the <unk> that i can show you today .
and suddenly amazon becomes the brand and <unk> , defined by the <unk> , defined how they want their money to spend , what &apos;s money .
maybe that seems to be a big jump ?
i don &apos;t have to explain to the audience that i &apos;ve probably had to explain last week -- -- skeletons are structures that make sperm from one individual to another .
and i already knew that animals like the <unk> here , or even most animals don &apos;t stabilize their tissues by chewing them over bones .
and this was because every child we found that we had found in nature , the same <unk> .
and i i showed you , were really surprised about this .
a funny song about global warming , by jill sobule .
okay , i i have to do now .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
<unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; are the benefits of a great education .
the <unk> <unk> totally out of this , and ben became a <unk> .
so on &apos;s going on , what &apos;s the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home , the democratic republic of congo , where i was <unk> .
but <unk> , the u.s. &apos;s chief chief , the nation &apos;s wealth has increased the wealth of the country over 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not the goal yet .
they would have to be very inexpensive .
but could it be done for this angle of the <unk> more ?
they were asking by governments to be faithful , and in many cases they have got them .
but let &apos;s say , our goal is to bring new economic action to the base of the pyramid .
because they needed to be a whole bunch of these little transactions to make their profit .
he liked sitting on his lap because he said it was painful for him to lie in his own bed .
since , as a last night , sir <unk> <unk> and the british society for <unk> , that the sun seems to be .
so , what is fusion ? here &apos;s something <unk> .
and this energy is it &apos;s going to take fusion .
it &apos;s something like a <unk> <unk> .
we have to make it a power station .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country , and it &apos;s also a great impact .
they were most of the democracy , but they were the people who had the population of the country who had their opinion on a officers in the last month , had a officers in the last month -- it was only four percent .
but the expectations of people would be significant in their future .
so the question is , &quot; what is the male support for women ? &quot;
i promise you , she read the message .
nobody can listen to them , they just put a text .
you could see the immediate effects of law or the <unk> talk on a <unk> , and see what happens as a result .
and the flight took 12 seconds and went over 35 m.
this is unnatural for a rocket .
it weighs less than a <unk> .
from the smallest forces of the <unk> forces of nature .
we can afford to be as individuals and give us hearing .
we think somebody else , somebody else , somebody <unk> , somebody who will solve more tools with this problem .
we didn &apos;t strike him in the pacific .
it took 10 full prototypes until we had something that really flew .
and so on one side , there &apos;s this incredible <unk> of what &apos;s possible , and this huge seriously , which means what that means .
and let &apos;s think of our moral chemistry .
and the director was quite <unk> , and told me that he thought me for crazy , and he said to me , &quot; this place is a <unk> . these guys are heavy offenders .
it took me several such events , until i discovered what i was supposed to do .
when i started this program four years ago , my <unk> plan was to create a <unk> of the <unk> .
and they &apos;re looking down at <unk> , everything is so small and tiny .
i feel blessed and happy that i had the courage to give up my post for a at the age of years ago and give up my home , where i could make these incredible rides with this group of <unk> children from ethiopia , morocco and russia .
and how often would my self die before i understood that it didn &apos;t exist from the beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
oddly , these findings don &apos;t mean my <unk> sense of sense , this sense of otherness .
that was because i didn &apos;t have myself , which was in between .
imagine what kind of existence we could have , if we honor the inevitable death of the self , value the privilege of life and to what &apos;s going on next .
and this is a cafe at the sea in britain .
but instead of focusing on this , we focused on the way .
and what we also discovered is that as a <unk> structure and a <unk> way , would get through that structure .
but what we found is that seeds -- this really important project is actually happening instead -- but that seeds -- in the leading states gardens , they don &apos;t get seeds .
we worked with a <unk> to develop a <unk> of the seed cathedral for that , even if you &apos;re visually visually , so it somehow was kind of <unk> and soft , the piece of landscape you see here .
it &apos;s actually just the first few pieces that you can see , and the rest is just for postcards .
the book is called &quot; blank slate , &quot; the <unk> slate , &quot; the the mind of the mind is a blank slate , and all its structure of its socialization , culture , education and experience .
well , there &apos;s a number of political reasons that they like people to be good .
it &apos;s still not clear whether this particular <unk> was appropriately , but the <unk> of the <unk> seemed to be able to support this .
another one of the <unk> and <unk> to the universities that are actually in decline in decline in decline .
now , the other hot iron is the .
and i think you can &apos;t say that better at all .
i &apos;m also calling <unk> , just like <unk> , and they don &apos;t like it , but they confirm it .
there is no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i &apos;m going to think right now . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer program -- that &apos;s odd .
so i wondered what would happen if we challenge some of these <unk> <unk> .
right ?
it &apos;s the way -- we &apos;ve explained the war as a society , each of us .
your iphone without the people , the same skin , the same circuits , the same keyboard , over and over again .
and then it became thicker and thicker and so it &apos;s <unk> pages long .
and i said to brian , &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; so , is it true that you have self-replicating in this ? &quot;
but how do you sit in an sane way ?
so all of the things that came out of tony at the <unk> , proof of his clinician that he was crazy in this new way .
he came in <unk> factories and <unk> 30 percent of the workforce , transformed american cities just like this in <unk> .
and i added , &quot; i have a list of psychopathic features in my pocket .
and the gems are always the most beautiful aspects of the .
anyway , that was two years ago , and this is where my book ended .
in fact , the trend toward the <unk> of the rest of the world .
and as a result of that virgins is , it &apos;s very , very difficult to say , i &apos;m going to <unk> the true islam . &quot;
it may be that a big war was between east and west , and it was necessary in a transitional democracy to communism .
and even though president , for reasons reasons , very , very well hit the <unk> of islam , there &apos;s no way to call islam , there &apos;s nevertheless , to call a natural impulse on <unk> the other side as an enemy .
when the treasure was in 2000 , you saw the peak of the best <unk> that the scientists had ever been before for african penguins -- that was in that stage , as endangered species of
the day after our arrival , two of us were given to the <unk> of 2 <unk> , and room 2 contained more than 4,000 penguins oiled penguins .
we &apos;ve used this method in the treasure rescue .
and this is really important because the african penguin was explained a year ago in a endangered way .
on the <unk> , on the <unk> , in front of a <unk> , in the <unk> and even before the police station .
people are open to the <unk> .
we launched this campaign -- very amusing -- called &quot; every egg counts . &quot;
this is not a second grade .
these teaching came out , abstract .
hillel turned on a leg and said , &quot; what you &apos;re doing is not your neighbor &apos;s mind . that &apos;s the <unk> . the rest is comments .
now -- that &apos;s not the whole story .
and achilles &apos;s taking <unk> <unk> and puts him carefully on his father , and the two men see each other and see each other as divine .
this is actually looking at me in biology and science , looking at living cells in the microscope .
every grain of sand has a size of a millimeter .
you can see these <unk> .
this is the beginning of the <unk> .
we all look at the same in the inside , believe me .
the walls are made from 700 millimeters a solid solid , solid concrete .
and that &apos;s a x-ray on the left is a x-ray .
it &apos;s got human associations .
in the x-ray , we see all the little <unk> in the corners .
i had to put the car in the middle of the car , and it &apos;s not really easy to do .
yes , they gave 12 monkeys for a week , and after that week , they only used it as toilet .
the science actually says that we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i &apos;m <unk> a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you very much . watch .
how do we know it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we &apos;re not going to agree .
not professor and <unk> , just two minds , ready to be ready .
and my life was okay .
and all i saw in the manufacturing was that there were right <unk> between the <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> .
so would we be time to process information ?
we spent a lot of time looking at a billion dollars a half , and they &apos;re listening to really a billion <unk> <unk> , which he was involved in , and what we found was shocking , but then more .
then there &apos;s dan etete .
we were upset that these shell companies had quickly had their <unk> , and the most important in london , <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s too complex and difficult to change it .
we &apos;re all dying . we &apos;re all getting old . we &apos;re all going to get sick . people are leaving us .
there are places you can &apos;t go , you can &apos;t think of worlds you can &apos;t be able to inhabit longer .
they have a <unk> and a freedom that i think is the foundation of a new <unk> .
she made the decision to get no <unk> or <unk> , but to her life that doesn &apos;t happen to any other girl .
we are all refugees .
but you &apos;d get this thing on your head , and then something happens .
but you don &apos;t . &quot;
i miss michael .
he didn &apos;t find that , he didn &apos;t get his staff , but he said , &quot; you &apos;re going to the rehab , or you &apos;re going to become fired and die . &quot;
ahh ! we meet them , the <unk> beloved . let &apos;s pull it out .
if it &apos;s on the box that &apos;s the <unk> , it &apos;s what it does .
the <unk> that the word <unk> are so often in the , that we should eliminate this age of old word when it comes to criticize behavior that is associated with <unk> and <unk> thinking .
if i give up the ability of my sister , 10 percent of the amount of interest i &apos;ve been on on my last loan , i &apos;m going to raise your ability to get more money from me until you &apos;ve paid it back .
it &apos;s the reason we don &apos;t live in the dark times .
and the third is all the sounds that we create people that are <unk> .
this is after selective <unk> .
there are many <unk> of soundscapes , the way animals have taught us that dance and sing , that i think for another time .
so that was extremely embarrassing .
and if you wonder , what is the thing that this is , this is 16 kb here .
so , 37 is our demographic demographic .
it &apos;s very impressive , and a very beautiful concert .
and these are the issues that actually are at the heart .
one generation that &apos;s much more important in video games than it is from the real world .
all of these are problems outside my <unk> .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games means for our civilization .
finally ! that &apos;s it .
and he would enjoy it really well .
so , you get quickly from simple to complex , if you do more . that &apos;s what we like .
and then they <unk> them , and that &apos;s what i mean , at least , that i thought it was a long time until she explained to me that they &apos;re thinking about it , so they think .
it &apos;s going to drive the other direction .
girl : there were a sphere and a <unk> , because it &apos;s two completely different <unk> , and if you drop them at the same time , they might fall .
but we couldn &apos;t train a thousand new teachers to save our lives .
and it &apos;s a <unk> . &quot;
after all , we &apos;re going to change ourselves as much as we have changed the world around us .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going to have incredible effects .
why do you do what you do ?
everybody would want the new version .
they &apos;re too much .
they &apos;re actually going to take back to that point .
i &apos;m going to put his words back in the order of order .
&quot; well , yes , &quot; i said , &quot; funny , you &apos;re asking this .
and she said , &quot; well , you don &apos;t need this again . &quot;
they were looking at that , and i was grateful because she was just saying , &quot; wow ! that &apos;s fine . &quot;
the goal of project is is simple .
this is completely personalized medicine in <unk> .
now the answer is a team team .
i work with the <unk> and the <unk> , which is some serious problems in the project , problems that should not have been .
in medicine , there are so many people who don &apos;t want change , not quite a , if an austrian engineer has the answer .
you can find really novel solutions that haven &apos;t been seen before , and just quickly and simple .
yeah , you guys , you guys got my life , because <unk> were around , by beautiful <unk> form .
no , but it &apos;s true ; the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the <unk> .
and i didn &apos;t want to to draw a nice cartoon .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth , &quot; brought me a lot about the audience .
we &apos;ve got a lot of time on the planet &apos;s existence than they &apos;ve been here before we reach the second microbial era .
his impact is the distribution of these very thin <unk> of all over the planet , and we had a very <unk> death of dinosaurs , death of this beautiful <unk> , <unk> here , and <unk> on here , and so much else .
it &apos;s the top of the rise , the t. rex .
they hate us animals .
this is when material comes from the depths of the earth and the surface , it &apos;s spread over the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m <unk> from the coast , what &apos;s going to happen to me ?
they have an accident . they have two choices : they will die , or they take the hydrogen sulfide , and we say , we &apos;ll say 75 percent of them saved , mentally .
<unk> : blessing and curse .
some of them are countries who think that deregulation or all , are no regulation of the best way to promote investment , to foster trade .
and the answer is simple : the chinese define these factories as chemical entities , not as <unk> , and don &apos;t check .
i don &apos;t know what to do , but i can use my office to at least to use it all together to develop a solution . &quot;
they need a safe environment .
now , we have the idea that it &apos;s the beginning of a new way of the national international task .
now human rights , to a very simple question , can i give this man back to this dignity ?
or finding the boys who put the fire in the beginning to see if you can change it . &quot;
okay , ready ? go .
i was fire and flame .
again , we saw the spoken spoken poetry <unk> .
after the struggle , he shook his <unk> , <unk> hair and said , &apos; you &apos;re a god . &apos; no , anderson , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
i travel a lot when i teach , and i don &apos;t always get to see my students reaching their third step , but i had lucky enough to see in their journey that their journey was how they did .
my parents have called me sarah , which is a <unk> name .
i want to talk about some ideas that have driven me to become a <unk> .
when i saw that the war for each of the people had such incredibly far-reaching consequences and that the yentl effect could actually become a factor in the <unk> , i wanted to be a photographer to be a <unk> .
at the same time , in south africa , after nelson mandela had been discharged from jail , the black population was the last phase of liberation from apartheid .
the next day i went to rwanda , and it was like i was up to the <unk> in the world .
after the fall of <unk> in indonesia , i began studying the conditions of poverty in a country that was on the way to modernization .
a hospital of doctors without borders , in refugee camp .
the skeletal society has become so efficient that the percentage of soldiers that survive a survival rate in this war is much higher than any other in our history .
to make sure that the way that we can walk wrong , we have all these procedures in the choice .
so you select it up .
but that &apos;s a broad and very difficult topic , so i had to raise myself .
the size of the population -- here &apos;s a big china , here &apos;s a big india .
and in all eastern religions , japan was the same same .
because death death is child child is <unk> with another child .
and what is the reason in qatar ?
they have a great <unk> .
all religions around the world are able to maintain their values and adapt to this new world .
and then , like all of our generation , we lived in a <unk> .
day eight .
in india alone , in the best of my <unk> friends , and i left door door door with this same image , every single house in india . we made a billion <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
i asked them -- they &apos;re all <unk> -- and i asked them those questions that they want to ask .
i think we &apos;re paying a lot of the gphin and ron st. john very much of gratitude , i hope ron is somewhere in the audience -- over there -- he &apos;s the founder of gphin .
larry brilliant : first of all , are you angry because of the injury of the copyright ?
have a <unk> movement , &quot; the extended group . &quot;
why should we want to have a positive impact on the world , in the world , as a company ?
they would save 85 percent of electricity with an led that they would have consumed with an old light bulb .
sometimes people think that 100 percent of the time will be pretty difficult , and we had this conversation in the business .
a <unk> paid for himself seven or eight years .
from our 17,000 <unk> , in all of us today , 47 percent women , but that &apos;s not enough , and we want to close this gap and follow this path to the high management .
there was a equation in my family , like this : if you &apos;re intelligent , you &apos;re not going to be spiritual .
this is what he wrote , &quot; is the integrated structure of reality . &quot;
somebody who &apos;s pursuing them or <unk> them from the ears .
at the end of the day we we realized the openness of the other .
as i go back to bangalore , i often to lively discussions with my friends , where we discussed various issues , while they were <unk> over new <unk> , where a drink often cost more than what they paid for 14 years old .
he &apos;s looking for forgiveness , and he said he himself to improve the life of his child .
this <unk> seemed quite happy , and it had not been to <unk> , although dozens of <unk> were killed in liberia .
and how are we responsible for it ?
it &apos;s troubling -- not ? -- that the media of the world is making a bad job , that a small group of activists to publish more of this kind of information than the rest of the <unk> combined .
j yeah . this was the front page in the guardian , and it was then printed around the world around kenya , in the <unk> and south africa press .
j the impact on the people who worked on it .
and there &apos;s lots of information .
i &apos;d be interested in just because of what we &apos;ve already heard -- i &apos;m curious about the ted audience .
and we said , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you have to be careful about the term hacker .
and just a month ago , this was passed by the <unk> parliament .
and from all these numbers , i &apos;ll start with just two or three variables .
this piece here can be pronounced very different , depending on where you are it .
first , i read about this in a complaint in a <unk> , which was between the <unk> for for medicine and seven <unk> .
so according to this experiment , the best <unk> for an chicken doesn &apos;t make it too short in it , but certainly won &apos;t let it too long in it , and a <unk> , <unk> sugar , <unk> sugar or saltwater .
and then the next summer , i worked under the <unk> of dr. <unk> at the <unk> in fort <unk> , texas .
and this insight is incredibly incredible for the efficiency of chemotherapy , perhaps for many different cancers .
for example , volatile organic chemical chemical pollutants that are found in our schools , and and in the workplace .
because all of these solutions are , of course , they &apos;re sustainable , and they &apos;re <unk> -- <unk> for our generation and for the following generations .
and immediately , a voice called &quot; kangaroo ! &quot;
after the conference , after my talk , people came to me , men and women .
difficult .
a prosthetic is no longer for the need to offset a lack of
we are all different from different perspectives .
i was this as a beijing , the olympic games .
about 80 percent of these <unk> are young people , under 30 .
and they &apos;re most likely to be most <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the banks , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> from europe and america of the products they produce .
they have a kind of means that you can get on a piece of chicken or fish , and it looks like cattle .
people think about following following : will we continue to reduce our environment further further than a higher gdp ?
there there &apos;s nothing up there , but the conditions were ideal to the <unk> .
now , the series has not been shown , so you &apos;re the first person to see this .
mars is more than the earth , and it seems to be as <unk> .
sousa was afraid we lost the possibility of that , quote , &quot; <unk> &quot; . they would take us .
but more importantly , bmi was used in general work to generate new kinds of new that they would bring for free to their clients , and then in 1940 , when <unk> was a <unk> with a <unk> , the majority of the <unk> .
and i ...
for the dallas i i &apos;m trying to do , i &apos;m actually going to ask you a good liberal , of course , to ask something about government , a mistake , right ?
this insight is incredibly <unk> , incredibly <unk> .
okay , i &apos;m not going to forgive anybody , but i &apos;ve just just been that the person on the right is a liar next to you .
&quot; honey , you don &apos;t see fat in it , no . &quot;
but another study showed that strangers are three times in the first 10 minutes of their time .
here &apos;s the <unk> with her kitten .
i &apos;ll say it again .
and you don &apos;t look at the eyes of the eyes .
we say , &quot; yes , as we shake your head .
it has been science much more <unk> to the daylight .
look carefully , and you &apos;ll see the <unk> smile all over the video .
in this much more livable world , it can be meaningful for us to be a little bit more clearly , in terms of our moral framework .
and that &apos;s not true , right ?
you know , we often think that language is the world we live in , but it &apos;s not true .
so what &apos;s as a <unk> , if not tragic , is strange joke about harry , <unk> as ethnic <unk> .
six months after that , without any any explanation , let me free .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m struggling with .
when i was 10 , i read james <unk> &apos;s &quot; <unk> country &quot; and at that book i read .
a new song gave you one .
so i took a little bit of time to study coke .
and in the remote areas of africa , it &apos;s hard to find a good road .
how do you give them incentive based on the effect that you &apos;re doing on these remote villages ?
don &apos;t tempt me as appealing as &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re waiting to be cut on .
a lot more people would have been bitten .
today i &apos;m going to tell you two things , first of all , what we lost , and second , we get it .
you can see the most important part of the animal &apos;s demise of florida .
if there &apos;s no fishing on a reef , because it &apos;s <unk> , or it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s great .
after a few years after five to seven years , the fish come back , eating the sea urchin , and then the algae grow again .
you can see the border of the sea , because there are all boats of spiders .
if it &apos;s so good , if it &apos;s so simple , how much do it ?
so protection of the population of the oceans and the oceans is a free for funding of governments and <unk> facilities , and it &apos;s not just to be .
in the coral reefs , we found that the pyramid is the equivalent of the <unk> , where five lions come to a <unk> .
okay , <unk> , thank you for having a part of your spiritual experience . thank you .
it &apos;s been the longest creature in the ocean .
they come to the sub -- they come with the eyes and the windows and the the the .
among other things , we &apos;re trying to do with our partners at the woods , this virtual world -- this world , this rich area -- to the lab .
bl : these worms don &apos;t have a <unk> . they don &apos;t have a mouth .
what we saw before , was from the pacific .
we &apos;re going to try to show you the pacific in <unk> .
these worms grow several centimeters in the week .
the concept of <unk> is futile .
and the rest of the one percent are <unk> to be <unk> by the formula they can use in the situation .
they also have the mathematical structure that &apos;s from <unk> , measurements , <unk> , dots , and so on .
the students have to be able to make this . they need to formulate them .
and the best , or one of the best parts , is that we don &apos;t get the answer from the <unk> at the end of the <unk> .
what &apos;s the little hadron collider happened ?
this is the fastest growing growing population of the world .
they &apos;re <unk> . there are no government schools in the slums .
this is a computer that was installed on the entrance to a <unk> social entrepreneur named sugata mitra , who showed the <unk> experiments that showed that children can learn from certain conditions , autonomously with help with a computer .
now , the key is motivation , and in two ways .
this is a school in a van on a construction site , the fastest growing city of asia .
you should turn it into a mcdonald &apos;s .
there are formal framework , schools , <unk> , hospitals , where innovation can happen , and informal environments , communities , families , social networks .
every child to the age of 15 , that wants to have a place in school , will be able to get one .
and as i look at it , this scene comes down to tears , and i &apos;ve been messing up with me for 25 years .
here &apos;s some of the parents of teenagers ? all the time we have to cook for them -- and they turn eating food for two , three or four , in the right , it &apos;s ridiculous .
he &apos;s spreading everywhere and it goes all over .
these gay people , like me , want to be treated as fully citizens , and it &apos;s written right before our nose .
there &apos;s a lot of fear that people have to do about their job , so they don &apos;t show who they are , here at home . it &apos;s not just north carolina ; in all states , it &apos;s legal .
think about that .
and i was getting scared .
about three years ago , i read an article in the new york times .
who were my grandparents ?
it helps us to what we could have .
that &apos;s how evolution works .
and in fact , here &apos;s this insect .
i &apos;ve just put one on somebody .
it &apos;s not only <unk> to 44 degrees fahrenheit , about two days , but it &apos;s holding constant temperature .
but the contrast is something like this . you &apos;re out of the background .
here , the americans beat the russians , and yes , it was -- actually -- a game .
she started to tell me about it , and all parents here are going to recognize the <unk> .
i have a <unk> of .
our lives are defined by data , and the presentation of this data is to us a chance to create fantastic interfaces that can tell great stories .
i also took a look at the different layers of pollen , because you can select what you want to choose from the data data .
it &apos;s a <unk> man sitting in the box and controls that <unk> .
a <unk> of about 11 sheep an hour , which is a <unk> of 68 cents .
because you can -- because -- what you &apos;re seeing on the left is the <unk> , and on the right side , you see the <unk> as he was interpreted by 16 people who had no idea what they were doing .
bj bell : bj , <unk> -- aaron <unk> : and we took all these pieces and <unk> them into another mechanical turk .
but we knew that we were all the right person to put behind us and build something for us .
and underneath that , all the individual people that submitted to the project .
thank you .
so i made a series of pictures , cut , and i put them together in <unk> .
a more consequence of this is that you &apos;re always seeing one part of your picture , and that creates a very free .
and sometimes i have an emotional reaction to news , like the earthquake in haiti .
then i went 50 kilometers , then 60 kilometers .
it &apos;s like the different layers that we &apos;re made of , and what we &apos;re presenting the world as our identity .
another <unk> is in a public library in san jose , california .
so every building has its own personality .
it &apos;s perhaps easier today than ever to get a good deal .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re particularly <unk> .
it &apos;s just too weird .
you know , in the middle ages , in england , if you met somebody who was very poor , called this one &quot; unhappy &quot; . literally , somebody who was lucky enough , the fate , the destiny .
and that &apos;s going to be doing this with the youngest court with angels and <unk> , and the sky will open .
i then told them the action of mental illness .
what i think i really talked about is success and failure .
we should make sure that it &apos;s our that we really are the creators of our own <unk> .
alain de botton : a <unk> , <unk> <unk>
if you train for this sport , you don &apos;t smile .
you know , you &apos;re swimming with <unk> , and you &apos;re going to add 60 trains per minute , so you &apos;re never really going to be on something , you don &apos;t see .
they &apos;re into the liquid .
my breath is down to three <unk> the minute .
i should worry about me , i didn &apos;t do it .
i swam with this thing .
it &apos;s the only <unk> that interests me .
that &apos;s already there .
the <unk> can be a smartphone , or it might be a particularly <unk> <unk> , like today , many of these things are special <unk> , because they &apos;re not so well integrated .
many of you have got the phillips <unk> life .
this is a important part of our life . we should sleep a third of our lives .
ok . now let &apos;s go from sleep to pathology .
so we can change the medicine in the <unk> , in all ages , from <unk> or <unk> kids to the senior , the <unk> arena ; the whole spectrum of the disease -- i hope i &apos;ve taught you a sense about the world .
so i hope i &apos;ve convinced you about -- the effects on the <unk> are enormous and the effects of disease are also so impressive in all these different diseases and more .
how do we create stable societies ? longevity .
and in the novel , a particular called alvin , which is , and he &apos;s saying , maybe that &apos;s not the best way , and it &apos;s destroying the whole system .
and so , there would be no <unk> .
and it &apos;s a great thing .
so it should be faster .
you might ask yourself how do we make these <unk> ?
we are the only cookbook in the world , in the <unk> <unk> .
this is the finished hamburger .
a talk about surgical robots is always a lecture about surgery .
and surgeons were more of business as doctors .
but ultimately , they &apos;re the quit .
they had to give up their intuitive movements with the instruments .
i told you about the big , complicated robot .
and you can see , as you can see , out there , doing something useful , can &apos;t remain that kind of thing .
and we don &apos;t even have to go to this <unk> .
we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
okay , well , it was partly my fault .
we &apos;ve not only shown that bacteria can be the solution for plastic , but also that the openness to <unk> <unk> and the cause of risks for the .
the film we &apos;re going to see you did for the <unk> in new york .
i &apos;m not a exception .
it continued . they always always tried to do things better .
they didn &apos;t say , &quot; our style is curves . let &apos;s make the house <unk> . &quot;
i think in my family we had a lot of luck , because we &apos;ve learned design backwards .
twilight , very good !
ed : and then , row is really a historical <unk> . there in the <unk> history , the paris history has taken place in the middle of the world , where the message was standing .
you see this chair ? the orange ? this is the <unk> <unk> . it &apos;s 1940 .
because it &apos;s part of where we want to get .
it was <unk> of outrage . they were full of speculation . they were <unk> . they were not solid information .
one of them is known : the population population . the world population , the world population , two to almost seven billion people in the last 50 years .
brent lawson : nice to be here .
you see the lines are when the population population is happening .
before i talk about the cost , i have to get very clear that that &apos;s very clear .
this is actually what liberation actually looks like .
but just since recently , we &apos;ve been able to make , thanks to technical progress , now the <unk> and quantum locking .
first , some strands of magnetic field are caught inside inside , but the superconductor may not like you &apos;re moving , because your movements use energy , and so the <unk> of the <unk> .
this circular magnet i can also expand , of course , to form a chemical rail .
and it was inspired by this quote from douglas adams , and the situation is from &quot; hitchhiking . &quot;
because obviously , you don &apos;t explain how to do it , you don &apos;t want to do it yourself and don &apos;t have a <unk> .
but even though they were not convinced , they said , &quot; okay , we &apos;re calling back . &quot; -- they never .

this graph is based on a brand-new article that &apos;s going to appear in the virtual <unk> biology .
but that &apos;s not all yet .
as an architect , i have something to confront .
mitchell joachim : don &apos;t build a house , grow it !
i find that very interesting and very unorthodox , because what you &apos;ve heard in the last few days is the sense of walking in different directions : directions that are specific and unique to the problems .
well , we all think that <unk> obviously was a great romantic poet , many of us forget that he also wrote some wonderful <unk> , and the most famous essay is one called &quot; an defense of poetry . &quot;
i &apos;ll read that to you .
and at a certain time of his life , they were moving on rock .
but let me show you the latest practice .
when you used to be before the digital radio , the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> , that was this noise .
the idea idea of the <unk> is that you have two sources of information that the conclusions are .
that means i need to make predictions about the future .
well , there &apos;s a very clear example of where one of my <unk> <unk> would feel like a <unk> , very different than one person .
and in the meantime , i got two daughters .
so they didn &apos;t know the rules that the other person was .
if these dots were on a filing cabinet , they would have no idea what &apos;s going on .
we &apos;ve shown that we can explain a big part of the data -- people actually planning their movements very precisely to minimize the negative effects of the noise .
this is from <unk> iv from atlantic iv .
mars has the largest <unk> of the solar system , the <unk> .
this is my <unk> . it was just a couple weeks ago .

the red dots are going to be the <unk> , and the yellow dots are going to be friends of people with flu .

what makes a place like the <unk> david especially remarkable , is this kind of <unk> , where people have a base that they can make to use .
we can just ask , &quot; what are the <unk> of the <unk> ? &quot; and then it immediately knows -- or what else we want to ask .
it &apos;s replaced the workers by technology .
you can see on the left of some symbols that show you what &apos;s in your right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re always older .
or even even when we get older , we &apos;re going to go to the cars so we can visit people .
they were gone in a moment .

the two specialists behind the curtain will help me get the outcome on the screen .
one of the journalists said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;

he saw her .
<unk> power : a complicated hero
this is the <unk> jobs and possibilities of all the <unk> .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> of food , because this year , last year and 2008 , during the <unk> enough food , there was a <unk> of calories .
and i go into these stores , if you &apos;re there , sort of like into the fields to see what you can get , and i &apos;m stuck , you can &apos;t get food .
we see changes in school school in school .
i want to talk about something i call digital food .
and what i found is that instead of investing in subsidies and other things , they invest in a school program .
thank you .
we could do the same thing in cancer .
they &apos;re no longer going to go to a <unk> .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a <unk> device , not because it tells me how many 15-hour i would edit every day , but because it &apos;s <unk> for 24 hours what i do .
this was never been shown .
the <unk> of these magnets is so big that we can see a single neutron on this technology .
you don &apos;t have to shrink the tumor .
if magnet is large enough , and your resolution high enough , you can actually <unk> all the proteins in your body and understand the individual system .
most of us find this comforting , and interestingly , 12 vibrations per minute is about the <unk> of a <unk> human .
for example , if i did this -- -- went to a couple of seconds , you &apos;d feel uncomfortable ; you &apos;re less than a few minutes , and you &apos;d leave your room in multitudes .
that &apos;s what everybody realized . and this is the melody that &apos;s been to the most frequently in the world .
and i stood there with two very good friends of mine , richard <unk> and kevin <unk> .
while we &apos;re flying miles and miles of <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , who could be <unk> .
as i &apos;m standing here today talking to you , i &apos;ve been talking about five years of about five years .
just 10 kilometers before shore , and in <unk> feet .
the ocean is dominating climate and weather , they hold the temperature stable and shapes the chemistry in the world .
there &apos;s easy to ...
that &apos;s the result , if you don &apos;t know there are boundaries of what we can take the ocean .
for the last three years , the u.s. states have <unk> <unk> sea as <unk> .
we need <unk> , new technologies to explore the ocean .
i was interested in a lot of my early career , i wanted to figure out how the wings of the insects were enough force to keep themselves in the air .
so let &apos;s explore this notion of simplicity .
this is a beautiful picture of the visual <unk> of a mouse from jeff <unk> . you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
they <unk> a <unk> to make some behavior , another <unk> , another <unk> , and you can imagine that this works in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a <unk> and <unk> model of the human brain .
he &apos;s home and drinks tea .
if you look closer at the surface of the neocortex , you &apos;d be able to make it made of some little components , <unk> processors , like in a computer .
how many of the tree tree is ? where are you ?
we can look at the tissue . and we can change neurons .
we can upload all these neurons , each one in its own processor , activate it , and watch what happens .
<unk> <unk> says that the secrets of the brain can be solved soon . mental illness , memory , perception : they &apos;re made of neurons and electrical signals , and he &apos;s using them with a supercomputer that lets the brain with <unk> synapses .
it would be two or three thousand bombs .
the air force started building smaller models , and it started this .
this is what nasa did to get a <unk> that would fly to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about <unk> behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write , because there &apos;s so much resonance you can get from people .
the lower ? yellow .
if you ask people this question , they think think that it &apos;s something to do with culture .
the countries on the right , the ones who give a lot of different , have a slightly different form .
i &apos;ll give you another example of this .
but to get it back , it becomes more complex .
a online reserve for 59 dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we really don &apos;t know our <unk> .
in fact , in medical care , this is our view .
and radio waves are limited .
in infrared , you can use the <unk> for the body to eat with lower energy .
their intensity can be very , very quickly , and it can be very quickly .
they &apos;re critical .
but that &apos;s just the way .
cars have <unk> and <unk> and can communicate with each other and and through the <unk> lights can communicate with cars and so on .
dna is what life is mean .
they actually aren &apos;t so many data at all .
you give your genome to your genome , and the power of it is a very different medicine that &apos;s better than today -- it &apos;s no side effects .
it &apos;s really simple -- just only <unk> genes -- but we could completely <unk> it .
we &apos;re not running as small organisms alone in the world , but they &apos;re part of a big ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we were poison or the earth -- but that &apos;s just a consequence of one of us .
now i &apos;m mainly here because there &apos;s a kind of digging in dog dog right now where we have people on the side of the side , thinking that you &apos;re going to take a dog , you know , just through making rules , human rules .
they &apos;re just so &quot; <unk> , &quot; just to beat . and therefore they &apos;re going to beat them .
no , we &apos;re making &quot; puppy , seat , &quot; -- bam , he can try to six to 10 .
they &apos;re like golden <unk> .
and i would say if she doesn &apos;t need it , you might not be it .
not just with the puppy , but with the rest of the family .
these <unk> are so simple .
your children are just to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and this windmill -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . still i still think of working with energy .
because even though i used scientific terms in songs , sometimes it &apos;s very hard sometimes to sound them .
and more rare when it comes accompanied by <unk> and <unk> , like in my case .
one is a white flash of light .
64 with 75 multiply .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert is growing a mile or two a year .
homo erectus , the same tool , was about 30,000 generations .
you can teach them to practice a little bit of <unk> , and there &apos;s actually a <unk> in other animals , but the exchange of an object never happens to another .
it &apos;s wealth ; it &apos;s the importance of your needs to save time .
we &apos;ve done that as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence for that .
and when people started to get objects like this , this was a clue that there was a exchange between groups .
but who knows how to make a computer computer ?
but that &apos;s me also because of the connections that people are taking , and that &apos;s how much of the ideas of ideas to meet and to mate , and i &apos;m sure that technology will continue on and so the <unk> will continue to improve .
it &apos;s as high as a <unk> building . i &apos;ve got the glasses as compared to the .
but we don &apos;t talk about that , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
they &apos;re just gone , these feelings , they have disappeared .
so if we think about the <unk> <unk> , then the fast development is the problem because how can we discover things that change constantly ?
i talked about that -- you know this situation if you don &apos;t get diagnosis in the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we <unk> a part of their viruses ; it &apos;s new , so far , <unk> rhinoviruses .
after 10 days of fever , she came back -- still fever -- she has <unk> -- little oxygen in her lungs .
it wasn &apos;t even sequenced very much .
it &apos;s a classic retrovirus , but it &apos;s completely new . nobody has ever seen it before .
it &apos;s a huge battery that could .
let &apos;s make something that fits the <unk> of the auditorium .
i got a <unk> with low density at the top , a <unk> with high density , and molten salt in between .
but david is young and smart , and he wants to have a <unk> , and he &apos;s building -- he then he &apos;s building the first metal with this chemical composition .
so what do we learn from all of this ?
this is a video taken in the <unk> , and six kilometers before the coast of <unk> <unk> , about 20 meters below the surface of the surface .
so quickly quickly , we realized that our garage was not big enough for this growing project .
i started to get interested in maria <unk> and the methods of how they were doing and how they felt like children find things themselves and not being taught them in an open art .
evolution is often often seen as this one way that we chose , but it &apos;s actually a huge number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to skip this up to the phase of space space .
our cities are endangered , because of them are at shore .
there are also stars and there are things .
so when we think about <unk> behavior or body language , what the scientists call , it &apos;s about language . we think about communication .
this is , even known as proud , was by jessica <unk> , and she showed that the people and birth of blind people , they do this , they win at a <unk> .
so i thought about it . you &apos;re looking at these people and you see them , could you get them to do it , and then they would be more comfortable ?
what happens to a <unk> , what happens when you go on the <unk> stage ? like the following little manipulation , these tiny <unk> ?
this is happening in the lab . the little exercise , for just a few minutes , where you really can apply that ? of course , that &apos;s what we really care about .
so people are kind of showing their true , and they show themselves .
she was completely depressed , and she said , &quot; i &apos;ve got nothing to look for . &quot;
they need their bodies , privacy and two minutes , it can affect the greater life in the big .
<unk> <unk> <unk> to get to the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , ant , <unk> her in the brain , drive her a blade of like a jeep .
and you have to have a kind of <unk> , you have to have an answer .
so it &apos;s , as i think , richard and i really important that these ideas are not abused .
and of course , they &apos;re essentially extinct in the .
but among all these ideas that are going to inevitably spread our technology around the world , many of the toxic ideas .
and as we do , we don &apos;t try to try to destroy it .
and in my game , it means you &apos;re <unk> .
we set up some ideas on the legs , we went international international .
i know you &apos;re going to say to me , &quot; t don &apos;t exist in music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody &apos;s listening to each other . nobody &apos;s familiar with the other .
you &apos;ll see the orchestra in a kind of <unk> <unk> .
i don &apos;t want to suggest that this should not have happened , but that we need to be better when to answer the questions that you have to consider when you think about the consequences and the reactions .
they &apos;re in <unk> . they &apos;re driver .
five dollars can save a life .
she earns about two dollars a day building just a <unk> , and told me that neither of them will have kids kids before they do things done .
finally , from desperation , they went and <unk> a wise old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , when you &apos;re angry , you &apos;re going to keep the best speech you &apos;re ever going to regret .
okay , the vast majority of us .
and his message was basically unity , the interconnectedness of everything and the unity of everything , and its fundamental value was respect , kindness to strangers .
who fights while he goes ?
they started walking , in israel and palestine , in jordan , in turkey , in syria .
and so more and more <unk> , and since recently , they have a income to support their family .
just go to somebody , with another culture , from another country , with another country , who is kind of different , and you get it into a conversation ; listen to him .
i &apos;m going to start where the story began , 1985 .
today , before you <unk> , who had the opportunity to shower ?
you see here -- 35 percent of these famous houses in which 50,000 aboriginal people live in , 35 percent of the houses had an ongoing shower .
21 percent of what we &apos;re fixing are consequences of <unk> , things that actually have been embedded around .
we did it . he got <unk> .
and later , we found out that in this region , the <unk> of disease and death is .
one thing about what we &apos;ve done is the middle of the <unk> , nelson mandela said not far from here : &quot; how slavery and apartheid is poverty is not <unk> . it &apos;s the work of people .
i don &apos;t care if they call me a <unk> . really don &apos;t .
it really sounds like to say this up here , but if you try to use it , it &apos;s amazing effective .
and that &apos;s where i &apos;m going to take you to , in which belief that children shouldn &apos;t be their community to live in a better .
this is the youngest <unk> <unk> workforce in america with our <unk> of the bronx .
this is a picture from the mayor of the bronx who <unk> the children in his house , not in prison so they felt <unk> .
we gave something back .
if you &apos;re large kids with small ones , you &apos;re the big , thick man in the middle , which is cool , and they create these responsibility under <unk> that is incredible .
now , you may wonder about these kids .
hold kids away from the shops .
stephen ritz : a teacher who <unk> the south bronx
second , i bet you &apos;re here as a <unk> , the difference here , is a increase from the <unk> right now , right after that sharp line .
by 10 : <unk> , the pig suffered a heart attack .
people with migraine , which <unk> a aura , have a band with <unk> neurons -- here in red -- that moves three to five millimeters per minute .
the problem is that 30 million americans have migraine headaches , and we need a <unk> . i think we now have that .
my first wish is that the <unk> <unk> for epilepsy , the <unk> , for <unk> -- is a <unk> acronym -- is used for treating other <unk> .
lawyers take cases in the hopes of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> the poor patients with compassion .
and a year and a half ago , four of the <unk> in ushahidi , by the way , called <unk> , is called <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
how do you know what it &apos;s important to ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i first got it to the first time to get it here .
these people below the barrier i call <unk> , because they really get out of the process to share their knowledge with the world .
they intend to use connexions as a platform to develop their <unk> and <unk> that teach teach the world to teach teaching the world .
yes , books , maybe 100 or 1,000 spending in year .
it doesn &apos;t surprise you all like , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of the <unk> are over , when people say , &quot; well , we &apos;d like to have three or three of them in our country to see how this works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> .
you can use a couple of thousand children with two <unk> .
so it &apos;s kind of like a electronic book .
everybody says that &apos;s a $ 100 laptop , you can &apos;t do it .
and this is the <unk> .
they click around things and stare at screens . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s a better way . &quot;
we &apos;re all going to play &quot; i love lucy &quot; on a big assembly line , and we can &apos;t keep up with information and we can &apos;t keep up .
thank you .
i think most people think that a mother , mother , will always be her child .
it &apos;s not possible . it &apos;s not possible .
it &apos;s going to be good . they &apos;re going to live .
one , prevent the <unk> .
two years ago , one of the mentor mothers came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better health system ?
the <unk> is how easy the system is .
if you look at the volume of gray matter at age four to 22 years , it takes in childhood what this graph shows . it &apos;s <unk> in early adolescence .
the idea that her father singing in the public , she had to get out of her .
this is the <unk> that we built together .
after the first year , it was invited to install the <unk> museum museum in austria to install it in his lobby , and i &apos;m happy to say that it stayed online , 24 hours a day , for nearly nine years .
but at night , while we were <unk> , i asked the <unk> , the <unk> would have decided that they would kiss sam <unk> .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place where my family works for four generations in the computer business .
i &apos;m absolutely , i have no idea what &apos;s on <unk> , but they &apos;re very <unk> .
the first thing you see in the <unk> is the terrible force of the <unk> .
it &apos;s carrying it around my leg , picks me up , brings me to a vehicle , and i can bring me to a doctor .
it was a depression in the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about you . &quot;
we &apos;ve calculated that 200 years of the end of our direct <unk> are the world .
it &apos;s so easy to see technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect <unk> like technology .
it &apos;s the <unk> of my <unk> .
i &apos;d like to think -- thank you .
and i can tell you , corn is in all sorts of things .
you should know that in every community , the number of <unk> are already increasing .
i ran three <unk> into antarctica .
but tell me where you are and what country are you . &quot;
we &apos;ve also explored the surface of the islands -- a very important repository for birds , one of the most important <unk> in the pacific ocean .
and we are the rest of the world , faced with a problem .
he coined the &quot; reverse <unk> . &quot;
of course , the <unk> and the open seas were <unk> , but the <unk> , which everyone would like to look at was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific , with huge <unk> and huge <unk> .
now there are <unk> , d.c. , automatic <unk> free for free to many of our devices , even on the smartphone .
there is an endless debate , there &apos;s no one , no one answer , but if you &apos;re a geek like me , then you say , &quot; well , what are the data telling us ? &quot;
instead , it has documented very carefully , which happens whenever technology comes to a place for the first time in a community and in a community .
so there are , of course , two different ways .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a yves <unk> painting .
i mean , it was at least as i made it happy .
now , there was a question that i had to take a while to me , well , you know , i can do more of the things that i like to do in design , and less of those i don &apos;t like to do ?
and here it is , it &apos;s from the front .
they are a terrible situation without any outlet .
they &apos;re going to be <unk> in hospitals .
so as a <unk> , for instance , i was considered <unk> in <unk> , because i knew the <unk> , and i know how to use <unk> , and i can work with the <unk> .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people in so many of my friends , in the &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s , &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s , and they &apos;re still active than <unk> , farmers , lawyers and doctors .

<unk> : there must be something we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous when a group is identified as an extreme .
<unk> <unk> : the islam of <unk> superheroes
let &apos;s look at this .
let me point it for you .
let me show you this .
and when i started designing , i was something curious about myself .
so they have the eye , and then they get concepts .
but of course , china has also a massive population .
but what this shows is that this kind of visualizing information is a form of <unk> .
and it &apos;s a pleasure to do with them because they &apos;re visual .
the <unk> is named after the eden project in britain .
why does it not smell like potato or <unk> ? so there are two theories .
and a theory allows you to work less .
now after a few months of cooking , i discovered there &apos;s a kind of molecule that &apos;s called <unk> , and that &apos;s exactly the same vibration .
this is the basis for the machine that these two people have built by ford .
they made it -- and it has just like coumarin .
that was a good thing .
right now , a number of things that i want to do is to you on .
and she had no idea of the context that she was in .
norman !
i didn &apos;t say anybody on goodbye , neither of my mother , my father , not my sister , my brother , my cousins , my cousins , my cousins , my grandparents , no one .
i reports of this . i reports about it just to say that i had two things when i left the orphanage that i wanted to do . one was to find my family and and the other one was to write poems .
and this is how we &apos;re looking for them .
and then you hope that one of us is going to find up there and find small bits .
he had a <unk> and he has to be <unk> by others , female and probably have been much smaller members of the age to reach his age of 12 .
is that a good evolutionary adaptation , or will it lead us to be the hominid species that exists on the shortest on the planet ?
but will we do that , or will we make nature take their run ?
one day , a couple of weeks or maybe a year later , i was in my shop shop in a shop for <unk> . i wanted to buy <unk> -- we had a <unk> plan .
that meant a fundamental change for me .
my hint : about 70 layers of this , , <unk> <unk> .
do you know how i really am ? this project is only for me , and yet i &apos;ve gone so far to buy a chinese newspaper from <unk> from san francisco to make the bird with it ...
when we went down to the <unk> blue mountains in the west of sydney , it was a perfect <unk> : sun , the smell of <unk> and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you ever walk again with a <unk> . &quot;
i remember my father was going to take me out in the wheelchair , and i was blown up up up to the bottom , and i was feeling the sun the sun on my face .
they said , &quot; we &apos;re going to put you next to you , because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;

i urge you to call a different science , which is still hundreds of old technology .
this is a magical place .
so i was going to rediscover the value of the <unk> .
and on the fifth of june 1995 , i heard a loud bang on the disk that changed my life and ended up with a duck .
and here we are the ducks .
after the price , my life changed .

and what happens when teachers want to enforce ?
and why not ? you don &apos;t trust the law . why don &apos;t you trust the law ?
because it &apos;s so freedom is a structure structure .
because life is complex . and here is the hardest and biggest change : we need to revive authority authority for the interpretation and the application of law and the .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise it will be <unk> alive .
put boundaries for the people who can calculate the <unk> and the fee that they can take .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really difficult to round columns with a ruler .
he had a very bad job .
he had just a <unk> last .
but the problem is leaving on rules and incentives , is that they &apos;re doing the job of doing the action , and they <unk> the most important activity in the mind .
so smart <unk> are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that any intelligent <unk> can maintain this for unlimited time .
now why has this spread spread ?
people want to be <unk> .
it was an extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to be the mentality now a little bit closer , which we -- america and the rest of the world -- had been .

what i want to show you is what they need to transport up to a lot of <unk> uranium .
what if they had nuclear weapons ?
we come down and bring the truck that they just saw , somewhere in the <unk> .
part of the problem is that the <unk> themselves , overwhelmed by the thoughts of a nuclear disaster .
it was sent to me from somebody who &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> , and that &apos;s the fact that america had heavy .
there &apos;s a lot of black sheep out there who did the wrong things and the problems have even dumped .
we can show our findings . we can do things better .
how can we tap them ?
it &apos;s <unk> to have a dangerous working environment .
imagine if we could , because if we could , we could achieve more .
the governments that make most progress are the governments that find ways to enable the shared value , rather than giving the government to see the actor who has the desire to say .
maybe i can cut down here , look at the brain , and i can change my cut .
i want to zoom in .
come on to the 19th century , and i &apos;ll get to june <unk> .

these benefits not only less wealthy men who are studying research , but they also also to to look at the <unk> , rather than answering just <unk> questions .
i &apos;m going to tell you about how i learned about life .
once you start looking at these very little things -- this person wrote a whole paper and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and everybody &apos;s not old enough , they have no idea how this infection happened -- which is that this is the dark one .
there &apos;s about 10,000 programs in there .
this would be the frequency in which you can find each of the 26 letters of the <unk> in one of random <unk> , a <unk> text .
all around the world is , you have this distribution , versus the distribution .
hot too hot too hot too hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot . hot .

instead of teaching people how to put the forms on the cell phones , we should develop software that enables them to do the self without practice and without my <unk> .
this is less than i &apos;ve given for two weeks when i was a consultant for two weeks .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life or the balloon , we need to change altitude .
that can be in spirituality .
and that &apos;s why they need <unk> .
i promised that the next time i was flying around the world , i will take no fuel , will be independent from fossil fuels to be safe , not being supported by the <unk> .
i think you need a pilot in the plane that can speak to the universities who can talk to students during flight , and can really do it a human adventure .
and now what is the goal ?
that &apos;s why all the people who believe in these beliefs are welcome to be part of this team .
now you need one laptop .
anyway , africa was a magical place for us .
the next thing that i want to create clarity is what this problem is and what it is not .
that &apos;s crazy , really , if you &apos;re thinking about it .
let &apos;s stop for a second with the nonsense .
the fact is that we can see the disease and this extreme poverty in the eyes , see at the ocean , tell about the ocean , tell it and i don &apos;t have to stand up for it .
it &apos;s going to the nerves .
this year is a test for us , especially for the leaders of the united states states who are <unk> and the the world .
people are starting to find out .
and with this one campaign as our chute , my organization , data , and other groups of the energy and the enthusiasm that out out from hollywood from the way from hollywood to the <unk> of america .
step for step , go forward , a nurse , a teacher , a <unk> , and life will saved .
the idea that the internet , which all changed their lives , can change a country -- and a continent that &apos;s just made to analog to the , let &apos;s fly it to digital -- blow my head .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
now your task is to recognize what these forms are and what kiki .
now if you &apos;re not <unk> , this sentence , literally , is , , wrong .
if we solve a problem or find something new , we compare what we already know about what &apos;s wrong with us .
nadia <unk> : i &apos;m glad to be here .
they don &apos;t adapt to all these these .
pm : i don &apos;t think so .
how are they all about it , they personally , but with their <unk> ?
some of my reporters have been arrested .
this is clearly a different picture of yemen .
my heart was three times too big .
this is a list of side effects : if you &apos;re too much salt , like a <unk> and <unk> sandwich , you probably end up in intensive care .
but soon i showed symptoms for <unk> , and i had to go back to <unk> , knowing that i probably never see my home again .
i was sitting there talking about a little bit of <unk> for the <unk> , and i asked him what i was if i needed a transplant , do to prepare for me .
i was hanging on a dozen machines that kept me on .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these <unk> is about 200 percent in the u.s. states .
what &apos;s also interesting is that the same company that &apos;s sold us the 80 million pounds of atrazine , the <unk> , which is the the vote -- -- and the same company .
we also started as <unk> .
what would our <unk> kids say to us when they were to to every child , every day , i had a little bit of <unk> , some artificial <unk> , and a little bit of a .
the problem is that you don &apos;t see the in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , we don &apos;t see this connection .
this is the buildup of the <unk> <unk> alongside the airport of los angeles .
i offered five cents for every <unk> .
the <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s become global .
here you see , in red , the spread of the <unk> .
they &apos;re like a mouse looking at the foot of a elephant , and the biggest part of them lies behind them .
it &apos;s from your <unk> and <unk> comes from all directions around us .
redwoods have a huge surface that &apos;s expanding into the sky because they tend to be something called <unk> -- repetition .
<unk> are the <unk> stability , just like at a cathedral , and help the tree , live longer .
it &apos;s absolutely impossible to see this .
but recently , all the doors have been torn up and the walls have come up .
this was 25 years ago .
so , let &apos;s see at the first time .
so how do these guys do with these infected computers ?
and they can afford to watch how we work -- how to work -- and try to find a way to the <unk> that we meet .
you &apos;ll notice that you can see down there , <unk> / d station , and if you open this image on your computer , this program will be downloaded and <unk> .
and if you look closer at the images of the scene , you can see that the <unk> of the mercedes <unk> is .
we need to make sure that everything is <unk> , even when the computers are .
but i do not have anything to do with it .
this person is with the consultants .
why should we think what he says ? &quot;
what does his future look like ?
these powers completely disappearing , nobody <unk> the 2011 .
it would be good if people were <unk> , and they were going to take this kind of computations , because this would change things , but it would change things in two ways that two different types .
that means that we can recognize a copy of ourselves , if you just used one of the <unk> , that in slow down and a bad <unk> and a <unk> .
and the happy couple , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from their <unk> and saw their video had spread up , like a <unk> .
thank you .
you &apos;re going to go to the distance .
that &apos;s what he taught him to do since he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor as an alien who taught me how to browse .
what is it that &apos;s going on today ? not 10 years ago .
what are you doing with what you &apos;re doing and let it happen ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . didn &apos;t have the -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager . don ...
right , moment , consciousness or subconscious , at the moment you &apos;re reluctant to focus on something , you can make it a meaning , whatever whatever it means , it makes emotion .
have ever done what , and be like , &quot; that &apos;s me . &quot;
so , <unk> . so , god in his infinite wisdom , we gave us another human need : the uncertainty .
but that &apos;s true : we need it . we can do it by intimacy , by friendship , through prayers , by <unk> .
and there are seven different beliefs . i can &apos;t go through it because i &apos;m through . the last element is emotion .
jewish man with a <unk> area , someone in new york , who had died if he had been at work , and this man who was a terrorist terrorist and he said it .
instead , i &apos;m interested in developing tools that which can tell a large number of people people people , people everywhere around the world .
the color of the particles corresponds to the type of feeling -- happy , positive emotions have colored colors .
we look like , &quot; i feel like i was the computer all day . &quot;
and if i go over here , the list starts to walk , and there &apos;s thousands of feelings that were collected .
the 10 issues of radiation and circle the time capsule .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : unveiling our modern mythology . &quot;
we can click on that and see this <unk> image of betty ford , how she &apos;s going to give the <unk> of her husband .
you can also look at quotes when they like to read to read .
so people are clouds as something that is in the way .
they started to live . it &apos;s now tens of thousands of members of the world today .
you just need step step out to go outside and to appreciate that so much as so playful as it is , everybody else is missing it .
so , look up , admire the <unk> beauty , and remember , wear your head in the clouds .
they would have recorded 25,000 recordings , they &apos;d have done this like this : &quot; <unk> , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the <unk> to buy my first <unk> , and it was a huge machine .
this is a footage that was obtained by a virtual autopsy .
so you can see how the knife is in the heart .
it &apos;s a little mechanical pen that &apos;s built in its inner inside very , very fast <unk> .
now , this is a really interesting project .
so he does it .
so , very skilled people .
i went to the kids as often as possible to bring the academic stuff with the real world .
it &apos;s not all , but it &apos;s an incredibly <unk> summary of everything we know about nature &apos;s basics .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details why we think of the universe , but it &apos;s out of mathematics and trying to explain physics that we know .
and i have a career in my career , but always something in me .
in 2001 , i went to see her during a <unk> .
we got a lot of takers .
this is what this was after the first graduating in 2004 .
he &apos;s just before the <unk> , and it was filmed recently with someone that you all know .
each one is being <unk> , but in different scientific disciplines .
i got my first computer as a teenager in accra , and it was a really great device .
he explores the brain using mri , and he said this is the most beautiful brain he ever scanned .
so , the next few slides i &apos;ll explain this to you .
and transistors will become smaller to enable and that has done a lot better .
and our our genome is behind this lens here .
i had such a gut that we were wrong with it .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so we know what a schwarzschild radius is .
i like to call them the <unk> of the <unk> , because they kind of <unk> .
we can see more detail in our galaxy than we see in other places .
and that brings us a factor of 20 .
so there was a bunch of alternative to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff there .
it pulls off a side of a lot more than the other , and the cloud is <unk> apart .
and i hope that i least convinced you , at least we &apos;ve convinced that we have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy .
and i was on the street one day , and i saw some kids playing between the streets of the streets , and i saw a <unk> baseball .
for example , in the 11th , people were cutting pieces that were so blown up .
in the first eight centuries of tradition , about this tradition was about the &quot; what &quot; to praise and prices .
through new and extended instruments , the age of <unk> attacks broke .
but one question is , what happens when the music stops ?
michael <unk> thomas : music and emotions over time
so we &apos;re at the beginning of a new <unk> .
by 1945 , they took it to 100,000 every year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about <unk> , although i don &apos;t know where to start .
wow , a volunteer , great !
but recently , my interest in looking at a new view of big <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of the place where there &apos;s a really cool thing to do .
well , i think this is the most devastating development of one phenomenon we call &quot; crowd-accelerated innovation . &quot;
but the element of desire is really the most important thing .
we get a great talk from them back .
let me introduce you to this point sam <unk> .
but even when you get the screen , there &apos;s a lot more than just just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share knowledge and data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
it &apos;s like <unk> global innovations .
one : i have to get a service to the audience and talk about what i &apos;m going to give you , rather than saying what i can &apos;t offer .
and they &apos;re going to be fun to design their own , ultimate , ultimate tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they hold them alive , and they give them the sugar , kind kind of <unk> that we call superpower .
this kind of tests is going , ok ?
somebody asked &quot; why ? &quot;
he thought he could reverse the waves . couldn &apos;t do it .
i think there are three big changes , in terms of transparency , choice and <unk> , where people have real power .
how do we do that ?
my <unk> , sharon <unk> , claims , around the world , are more photos of your head than any other .
11 of of the countries .
and secondly , the teacher looked at the <unk> and <unk> as a helpful legal means , because they were using a specific amount of areas where a <unk> is meaningful .
so i wish for all a beautiful weekend .
and reading dna , writing , gets more and more cheaper .
<unk> work alone .
now you might ask , &quot; what would i do in a <unk> ? &quot;
if you have this <unk> around all over the world , this can lead to a consumer that allows you to be able to make biotechnology .
the kingdom said , his laws allow him to be foreign <unk> or <unk> , which is an economic risk or a <unk> or a risk of health care or the <unk> of the state .
these laws are a slap in the face of the and based on prejudice and ignorance and a <unk> of traditions and a <unk> .
why are you going to pregnant when you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 <unk> is people who inject drugs .
so that social networks that are giving to the condoms of endangered <unk> , not even being <unk> by the police , are mapped or randomly locked up .
here were children born , people died there .
office for personal work is already obsolete .
they &apos;ve removed the high line , the road , the river below the street , and you come from one end of the end to the other without crossing the <unk> .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny apartments . &quot;
it &apos;s also to be shared .
their liver is emitting oil oil .
and they killed around 12,000 sharks at that time , actually , by actually putting a <unk> from the <unk> bay in <unk> bay .
we know very little about them .
so this tag is finding the place of a shark , depending on time and the sunset , the temperature and the depth .
if you look at the i.q. revolution , what has been to the genes that are passed from the parents , we see that basking sharks compared to the first study , one of the only 10 fewer diversity than other people .
so brazilians moved this research and found that the size was about the moon .
and what was fine . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build this . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the shark before we take a sample , we can tell the geneticists if they were from a male or a female .
so i decided to give myself the merchants .
their bodies are broken up with <unk> , and they &apos;re designed to be used for any <unk> to make money -- people tell many such stories .
no business with anybody .
my journalism may not fit on other continents , or other countries , but in my part of africa , but it &apos;s about corruption , ask people , &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in downtown manhattan , two blocks from the <unk> of the <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t be a <unk> <unk> .
and did these guys ever consciously met a victim of their <unk> ?
today , in 29 states , you can be fired over half of the country because of its sexuality , because of its sexuality .
i i thought that at some point my mission &quot; onion &quot; was really down to me , because there was a million different <unk> of gay .
at least i hope it will be harder to get your rights .
one is the world is , and it &apos;s always been good and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang are the most primitive .
and thirdly , i had access to all 1,000 pictures that the soldiers had made .
in three ways , the prevailing way is called the <unk> .
this is stanley <unk> , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he asked himself , &quot; could the holocaust happen , here and now ? &quot;
&quot; my lord , who is responsible when something happened ? &quot;
stanley <unk> and i was both <unk> at the high school at the way , at james <unk> in the bronx .
here &apos;s the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
<unk> of the others . <unk> of self .
alexander <unk> says that the border between good and evil is the heart of every human being .
and i was the the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what everybody could do , &quot; no big thing to jump on the rails .
it &apos;s a mystery that was really very difficult to give .
we have a self .
but on my left retina , a spiral <unk> , which is tagged through the red arrow .
there &apos;s only one of the body , which is the body .
i promise i &apos;m not saying anything about it , except that she &apos;s supposed to be scary .
and the autobiographical self has extended memory , thinking , imagination creativity and language .
thank you . thank you for being a <unk> -- and <unk> hill .
now i &apos;m telling you this -- i tell you , and i &apos;m telling you , to reassure myself , because i think feminism has partly the task , admit , aesthetics , and beauty and fun .
we don &apos;t want to be a heroine .
now , you &apos;ve been able to figure out , i haven &apos;t set up on fire .
she talked about <unk> , she started <unk> , she organized a , she <unk> friends -- all these daily acts of care and creativity .
i mean , it &apos;s this <unk> that is the homo sapiens that the homo sapiens that we have in the previous <unk> .
in fact , this is a sensor for brainwaves that reads the electrical activity in my brain while i think this talk .
we &apos;re <unk> of prototypes and products to live with thoughts that can be controlling with thoughts like <unk> appliances , or a cushioned chair .
the headset is wirelessly connected with a ipad or a smartphone .
how these children can use their new minds to their own , will be many of the physical and <unk> social <unk> , people who are diagnosed with a different than seeing .
they understood the power of human narrative , and that the value that we &apos;re impacting people , changes , changes and growing .
and said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate ? &quot;
my skills and my opportunities .
but gradually , they gave them unexpected , they gave up .
this was not a specialist to study my eyes .
i walked a track that i know well .
and quite , quite slowly , it happened .
i didn &apos;t really believe in myself , not really , not to all the stocks of me , all the little <unk> in all of us .
that &apos;s me . i &apos;m my whole .
what we have is the same thing , the same activity , but at one of them , they feel great , and in the other , with just a small change in attitude , they feel awful .
but i think it &apos;s another debate that needs to take place that is about the level of control that we have about our tax .
for <unk> percent of this money , you could have install <unk> in the trains , which would not have reduced the duration of the journey , but what the pleasure and the <unk> would have improved .
i &apos;m not asking for the full topic of one thing .
sometimes the lines are very , very long .
i think the world &apos;s danger in today &apos;s world is that the field of economics is understood as a <unk> discipline of human psychology .
if you had 50 to 60 percent , the average response would have been .
it will <unk> you you don &apos;t himself , or hurt others .
yay !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years back .
but that didn &apos;t mean i have a coin on both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but this is our skin of the visible universe .
thank you .
we had hyperscore , we had a very strong effects in children around the world , and now people in people .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful that wants to live forever .
hello . my name is dan <unk> . i &apos;m 34 years old , i i <unk> .
this is actually the score of <unk> <unk> that he &apos;s composed completely in hyperscore .
odysseus would have said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do a <unk> .
there &apos;s the present self .
i have to give five pages a day for articles , or i had to give five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that this is going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you , the last <unk> machine machine is something that i created with hal <unk> , who was imagined by my co-author at a previous project , bill <unk> .
it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not about people people , because if one of the faces smiles , then the other face is <unk> .
this is one of the reasons that we think of all of the science and math and <unk> , actually in the first few centuries of our <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
x is the unknown because there &apos;s no &quot; sh . &quot;
so it &apos;s not surprising that when you talk to the subjects of psychiatric disorders , you &apos;re probably going to hear stories of <unk> , shame and discrimination in almost all the life life .
a little over 30 years ago , the nations of the world gathered together in <unk> , and they gave this legendary explanation .
what is it ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve already heard of fish .
if you look at this profit , you can see that almost 8,000 of these dollars are actually <unk> .
this was in the early days of india , when india was going to be <unk> his <unk> -- as a <unk> to the recovery -- after the age of eight , nine , 10 percent , and wondered : why can &apos;t we do that too ?
that &apos;s not what you &apos;re happy to do , but you have the confidence and the audacity to <unk> and say , &quot; we &apos;ve calculated that .
so , carbon dioxide , the emissions from deforestation and agriculture , and flow carbon together 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved to win .
i didn &apos;t know what these things were , either not -- sydney , by the way .
i also liked these intellectual <unk> .
and he said he had essentially exactly the same relationship his father .
there was a theory .
he did it again in 1968 .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move around the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed the whole <unk> , and the <unk> color , which just <unk> these fantastic <unk> .
a lot of these ideas are produced into the ground for airstream .
if you think about sending your children to tinkering school , they &apos;re going to come back with <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
but let them play with them under their own conditions , trust me , they &apos;re going to learn things that they cannot learn from the <unk> of the <unk> .
if you want to throw away a device next time , you don &apos;t .
i think that &apos;s all . this is number one . okay .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and here &apos;s my wife walking across today , four months after that , in aspen , and in good constitution .
how about a completely <unk> <unk> , not just sharing ?
this is one of the seven even existing <unk> that weren &apos;t being shot into all .
and so it came out , in <unk> , the western <unk> started buying <unk> to first thousands , then hundreds and thousands of thousands of individual , little paper that would take a middle of hell in the sky .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about hidden connections .
so as edison invented the light bulb , they looked something like this .
you have to be quite smart , and even though i have no <unk> , that &apos;s not that i &apos;m dumb , because nowadays you can &apos;t be stupid and you can get it in the world .
they literally got rid of the door .
if you listen to the <unk> on your <unk> , both ears both of you are .
we have the problem that the antenna is going to be .
thank you very much .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and <unk> .
i &apos;ve recently created some pretty sophisticated <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
and i drew for every person to their own special map , and they wrote their name on it , and they <unk> them and they sent them .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you &apos;re going .
and i believe that it &apos;s <unk> , my precious and limited life on this earth just to it .
in this mode , he &apos;s trying to keep his position .
i thought i &apos;d tell a little bit about how nature creates materials .
and we think about future technologies . we start in the beginning of the world .
and if you zoom in , you can see the amino acids with the <unk> , where they have different charges .
and through a series of <unk> , you can get one out of a billion fish , what you want , like a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you can see <unk> .
if you ask people the question : where do they go when they &apos;re doing something important ?
i was sitting on my desk , i used my expensive computer .
what happens then -- sometimes you have this days when you wake up in the morning , or at seven or when you get up , and you &apos;re like , oh , i &apos;m not really good at .
in the office , most of the blood and distractions that people are actually doing work , they &apos;re <unk> .
we all know that &apos;s true . they would never experience a <unk> meeting that by employees .
so , meetings and managers are the two main problems in companies , especially in offices .
maybe every two weeks , or every week , a week , <unk> , nobody can talk to .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;ve been doing this for seven years , and i have no idea what the future will look like .
but if you ask people about three most important things they &apos;re wearing , -- no matter what culture , what culture , what context -- say most people -- say , most of the people : keys , money , and if they own one , the mobile phone .
but , and this is a very big , but we have forgotten to forget the tendency .
well , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent discount , and then , the owner &apos;s <unk> takes 10 or 20 percent , and gives the rest of the <unk> to my family .
it &apos;s a norm .
and somehow he has a credit for the values of <unk> .
at the same time , with the spread of these mobile devices , we see an expectation of availability .
our current reality is less interesting than the history we &apos;ll talk about about it later .
what are we talking about ?
dean ornish shares new research research showing how the <unk> of healthy life can affect a human level in the genetic level . he says that when we do healthier , better eating , exercise and love more , our brain cells actually actually .
until i tell you who said it .
within that context , we can think of regret about many different things .
when i got home at night after i got my tattoo , i stayed down almost the night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s a fifth one .
i mean , even the stupid &quot; answer to all of &quot; let &apos;s let us back in <unk> .
and as i said earlier , i &apos;m a <unk> .
i thought i would try to turn on my ted wish , what i &apos;m trying to do , and how this fits to what you &apos;re trying to do .
none in india . now , at least half a million active .
and i thought that somebody in this whole unified world has thought about the organization of <unk> .
and so we did to do that .
listen to this : less than four tenth of one percent of the people who have been treated , they were fighting to grow their drugs in the <unk> of their treatment .
it &apos;s a try and i think it &apos;s successful .
the <unk> are not <unk> .
if the <unk> is used , it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity . day and night .
and people bring their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , with the green school .
<unk> women from bali cooking cooking to <unk> and they use secrets that know their grandmothers .
we need somebody who &apos;s come and studied it .
green school is a model we built for the world .
my tongue , <unk> and vocal were still healthy and not . &quot;
then apple came out , the best voice i had heard .
there was a reason for this : i was .
the <unk> is not natural .
but that &apos;s not what it &apos;s about .
initially , the internet for me was a <unk> tool . now it &apos;s something that i &apos;m going to leave for my real , daily life .
it &apos;s human to ignore disease .
you all know the test for artificial intelligence , the turing .
i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what are you living ? &quot;
we treated two <unk> pages as one side , because that &apos;s how the readers are true .
so what &apos;s the lesson behind this ?
but one day my grandmother said , &quot; no , this is what you &apos;re running away from .
it <unk> and terrible things happened with me .
they lost hope in my recovery .
so they went to their <unk> , and they all raised their <unk> furniture -- they gave me a and <unk> , <unk> , everything .
they don &apos;t know how far away this street is , and they don &apos;t know if they go straight and they &apos;re going to go and go and and they had a horrible crash that they put it in .
i thought for some reason there remained there and was waiting for family and friends .
for example , understanding molecular structure .
he took me to the <unk> of <unk> .
can we say we would have discovered all symmetries of the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it off because i put up a small hurdle , right ?
if i <unk> a magic train and then one , it makes a third .
galois has a series of laws for how these tables , these symmetries , interact .
such symmetry is what we call <unk> .
instead of being confused , i want to know how many digits the number . ok ?
i need your name . symmetrical objects basically , and please , please spell it for me .
one : bad diets , maybe shorter .
thomas edison had have very <unk> in a software today from today .
penicillin was discovered 1928 , yet even in 1940 were not have been autobiographical and medically useful amounts of it .
it was the origin of the <unk> that had last year his 50th birthday .
and to me , the lesson of unintended consequences is that chaos now happens . we do the best of it .
works with every computer and browser . minus , minus , minus and the text gets smaller .
you don &apos;t need to delete it .
and so a kind of information source that i &apos;m inspired to inspire myself is my real desk .
a means of being a <unk> of something like a <unk> , so you get the more traditional desktop . things are on grid .
now i get to the heart of the people , and there &apos;s no boundaries .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s metaphors with bite , and with such a bite i want to suggest that we &apos;re doing a little bit rethink the role of contemporary mathematics a little bit -- not just <unk> , but math generally .
and he said , &quot; well , there are 2,000 physicists today on wall street and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find them here : this is a book on flies that you might have on amazon .
these are not <unk> ; that &apos;s culture .
you can do it very , very long .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s actually so interesting .
here we go . shake .
i want to tell you a secret .
so , <unk> without traffic , with <unk> , which are lives , but there &apos;s a excessive reduction of them .
and the answer is , let &apos;s get cars from this side of the street .
warren buffet disagreed , to say , to say what &apos;s going on and what doesn &apos;t and to do this to an annual thing .
in fact , what we &apos;re seeing is that it &apos;s the only known disease because of africa , people have actually been several things in africa to avoid the <unk> .
this is that the economy is increasing in these areas , because it &apos;s just so much prevents .
but we don &apos;t have a <unk> yet .
not only was she weak ; she &apos;s getting weaker .
one teacher of the top quartile will be the performance of its class -- measured by <unk> -- in a year by 10 percent .
but it &apos;s not a relationship to being a better teacher .
what &apos;s going on here ? &quot;
and these free courses could not only be available on the internet , but you can also make dvds all over the way to an access to the <unk> teachers .
common vessels , like this cup , need eight to 10 hours to burn .
sculptor richard serra talks about how he thought he was a painter , he was a painter and he lived in florence .
when i look at these photographs , i would return the smoke back to my clothes when i left home to my family at night .
my parents were great . they said , &apos; we know you &apos;re scared , but let &apos;s just go tomorrow .
but is it so bad to hold us for this powerful ?
this is a little bit of general in boston .
the pathologist takes the <unk> , <unk> it , <unk> it , examine it under the microscope and then then the operating room .
so in this case , a solution , with these <unk> molecules , with a dye , pictured green green , injected into the <unk> of one cancer , can &apos;t separate these molecules .
with metastatic lymph node , part of our current <unk> addiction , the surgeon is searching for the individual nodes , the lymph node , where the cancer begins .
if nerves are damaged , they can cause paralysis , and pain .
if we put these two samples ...
we know that this is doable , and we &apos;re determined to realize this .
and this cell is one of the thousand different streams of bacteria that we &apos;re learning from .
it will affect the healthy circuits as the the the the who they want to repair .
and then one in the summer of 2004 , we tried it and it &apos;s been the first time .
we &apos;ve shown that already a short run of these cells are enough to make learning .
and it goes . now .
i want to end with a story of the story that we think might be possible to find clinical practice .
now , you can see that the animal actually actually the walls and goes to the little platform and can use his eyes back .
buildings are embedded with the air that <unk> with the windows and through the windows and over mechanical <unk> .
and if you stop out outside , the air is microbes that are associated with <unk> and <unk> .
obviously , i &apos;m a very strong person , as you can see , so i had no idea to carry this thing out of 20 blocks .
the same thing true for the question , who was to be alive the streets of september 11th ,
and you can get a list .
one of the things i &apos;ve been working on is something called google chunks , basically you just take a abstract term and searches at google afterwards , and then you &apos;re looking for these results after somebody .
this is britney <unk> . i mean , ok , interesting .
if you have the second page here , you link one of them .
what was normal for us of us 40 years ago -- the story of stories between generations -- is rare .
<unk> in 1939 , the movie is older than most grandparents &apos; grandparents .
was the story about ?
why don &apos;t we see that with the same passion as reading this ?
in california , they &apos;re sent to a <unk> , &quot; this product contains chemicals that are seen by the state of california as a cause of cancer , <unk> and other <unk> . &quot;
so maybe we could develop a <unk> that requires humility , and for my profession as an architect , it &apos;s a fortune that the words &quot; humility &quot; and &quot; architect &quot; has been mentioned since &quot; the eternal diet &quot; &quot; no longer mentioned in the same paragraph .
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was , &quot; the stone stone did not end because the stones were out . &quot;
and it can be all right for berlin , but we &apos;re building <unk> in houston , and all the windows closed , and all the products that obviously aren &apos;t designed for use in air , is actually a vertical <unk> .
if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure most of you are using it .
since then , we &apos;ve taken the 4,000 <unk> in a database that we &apos;re going to put in six weeks of public public .
now we have a <unk> of heavy <unk> learning the internet learning programs .
we started to create commercial and mixed use of buildings so that all of the people and places where they can stop .
and this is the <unk> <unk> in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . let &apos;s not tell anyone that we knew this already because we didn &apos;t know .
for example , they give that the <unk> at microsoft was launched on microsoft on september 11th , 2008 , and then the other : google , facebook , skype , shrimp and so on .
i chose sweden because sweden has similar laws like the united states .
and whoever tells them he didn &apos;t have thought of it about this very long time .
their email has read , and she was talking to the <unk> and said , &quot; if there &apos;s no no <unk> , there can be real freedom , and therefore there can &apos;t be effective democracy . &quot;
many people , if you see a fresh human brain , a lot of people , say , &quot; usually it looks different if you show a brain . &quot;
all of these empty areas are the areas that the <unk> are gone through .
and the nature of a particular cell , which is to touch its biochemistry is that it causes the 25,000 genes to the and what threshold they are turned on .
now , experts come in and they make basic anatomical <unk> .
we take this material material and put it into a <unk> .
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
they look at their whole genome , and they &apos;re trying to find <unk> that are linked to genes .
whether that depends on individual genetic background or your experience , we don &apos;t know .
do we know how to kill poverty , we just need to do more for it ?
so here are some more questions .
how do you know ?
so what is the problem ?
well , before that was the same .
and there were many experiments done , all of which came to the same outcome , so i &apos;m just going to talk about one .
so what is the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it , and we have to steer the politics .
and maybe we start small , with things , where we are certain that they work .
poverty is more <unk> than scientific work and a lack of data on the effects of <unk> , the question of how to give them , but <unk> esther duflo says it &apos;s possible to find out what damage of the brain and what damage -- with <unk> studies .
so we start , because africa is , in a certain way , in the commercial level .
and the legend reported that alexander went through these desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa with 1,000 languages , and it wouldn &apos;t move . &quot;
so we &apos;re looking at countries , and we look at the specific materials and data .
i want to talk this from the perspective of the <unk> .
in tanzania , last week , the standard of standard <unk> was launched .
if i had to ask you , &quot; what was the average performance in 2005 the world &apos;s best performance ? &quot; would you think of egypt ?
because there are fascinating possibilities .
&quot; god &quot; is the journey we all want to be , inspired and feel one with the universe that <unk> life .
you put a switch on -- there &apos;s electric light .
i don &apos;t know why , but they thought that .
i &apos;m going to run this up so you can kind of take it together and i &apos;ll describe my reactions when i first saw that .
right .
ok , move , raise the right hand .
kt : yeah .
kt : no , no . i just look at the street .
i couldn &apos;t see through the blindfold .
get away again .
kb : how often did you feel that ?
let &apos;s close your eyes , five , three , two , one .
it &apos;s only when you want the pressure released , you make a <unk> , like , but only if you want the pressure released .
do you want to do it ?
you &apos;re just feeling a certain sensation , and if you feel emotion , i want you to throw the <unk> into the bottle .
there &apos;s one thing i want to share with you .
ready ?
my hand is , here , here , in <unk> .
kb : ok . you think it &apos;s here , yes or no ?
first , we have keith barry shows how our brain can <unk> our bodies -- with a trick that works with a <unk> , and then he sets the audience in some amazing <unk> of the brain brain .
i was <unk> .
it &apos;s not for the one of the legs . it &apos;s for all four .
i saw that both religious and trustworthy people are equally obsessed with morality .
the <unk> is almost zero to zero , if there &apos;s no stimulation to the <unk> .
and they get the message from the computer , &quot; person one has sent them this amount of money .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin was <unk> by <unk> by 80 percent .
i only found the molecule .
he asked me , &quot; what should we do ? &quot;
experiments experiments , we have men testosterone .
so what that tells us is we invented this ritual to connect us with this new pair of emotional .
and it &apos;s very easy to engage a brain for a .
so to run the machine , you need a lot , many people .
or should you not be that ?
so they were very <unk> : &quot; you &apos;ve given us a device that works only in english , so we taught ourselves to speak english so that we can use it . &quot;
i decided to destroy my own argument by making a ridiculous statement .
absurd . but i had to follow the victorian norm .
what is the going to be tomorrow ?
we need to go back this imbalance , from threat to delight .
i think that &apos;s exactly the focus here .
i &apos;ve asked quite incredible questions -- &quot; when was the world &apos;s beginning ? how will it end ? &quot; -- on nine-year-olds .
and just one last thing .
maybe maybe we should go to the next piece , because i just lost the thread .
<unk> went to local local <unk> in uttar pradesh , and found that he was born in the official <unk> as a dead .
so this is the area of <unk> .
<unk> is in the privileged layer that is able to pay multiple <unk> and multiple households .
after these four children , you see <unk> young sister who who who are the children who were killed .
and finally , there was one single guy who sat around for me and he later his participation , so i had to <unk> him so that he was <unk> .
16 16 , the kids have to leave the orphanage , even though they can &apos;t go anywhere .
and one of the interesting things is , of course , is the combination of the naked hand on the instrument and the technology , and of course what he said about listening to our young people .
now , my career could continue something longer .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
from him from the sound , the sound comes through the <unk> .
or we do this and believe that &apos;s what blindness is .
rain . not bad . not bad .
individual <unk> . but why can &apos;t i do that if i learn a piece of music ?
in this <unk> <unk> , the dove <unk> shows the dove <unk> why listening to music much more than sound to his eardrum .
and it became so big , until the point where there was a <unk> <unk> at <unk> &apos;s thanksgiving , and rick <unk> &apos;s and &quot; millions of people on tv . &quot;
but that &apos;s not the interesting thing about it .
cp : you &apos;re lucky to be <unk> to be <unk> .
peace and love mentioned .
cp : yeah , but you &apos;re not sure you &apos;re supposed to know what you &apos;re supposed to hold .
this is 10 times longer than the mammals needed to reach their maximum height and conquer all of these habitats .
we &apos;re very much the dinosaurs , and we &apos;re unusual in our <unk> attitude .
basically , it &apos;s a country that didn &apos;t have a <unk> at the beginning of our work .
this is a adult <unk> in his pine jaw .
paul has never seen a fossil that way .
these are all <unk> . there are a number of possibilities .
i became an artist , and i started drawing .
the question is -- and we &apos;ve been dealing with this question for centuries -- how to engage these kids in science .
bad news for derartu tulu -- some other runners had the same idea , underneath the olympic <unk> and paula radcliffe , which is a tremendously , the fastest <unk> of all time .
show me an animal with <unk> and gills , it has to do with water .
we don &apos;t use our physical strength because we &apos;re the largest <unk> in the jungle .
now , emily <unk> -- one of 500 <unk> and <unk> -- she ends up looking at the place , under the best 10 , although she had made all the paws to her baby , and she <unk> her baby -- and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s all we could .
but maybe it &apos;s different .
stop putting on the focus on these <unk> where you failed when your four hours .
in the practice , it was always been to interact with things , not with people -- certainly not in a social way that would be , of course , to be able to accept robots as part of our daily life .
cookie cookie is quite , very bad .
the <unk> was a experimenter from our group where they used three of three different technologies to interact with the participants .
and with this technology , you can become such an active participants in the life of your grandchildren in a way that it &apos;s not possible today .
and the third opportunity was a simple journal of paper and pencil , because that &apos;s the most <unk> you normally use when you start a <unk> and a <unk> .
another important idea is this idea of the <unk> of character .
i have a style , <unk> , very hard , because it &apos;s not drum , it &apos;s not , but being <unk> .
it &apos;s gone away , not a long . i fire : &quot; bam ! &quot; the <unk> falls between two <unk> cars .
when he wrote on a <unk> , i was in front of the door .
i &apos;m going to show a number of photographs and movies , but i &apos;m also making <unk> , books and some advertising , all with the same concept .
and from photography , this <unk> , they <unk> desire and <unk> , and what you can &apos;t have , you want to be the more .
as they went into collective consciousness , without knowing that , we know what it is .
it &apos;s very commercially .
and then you turn the picture that he &apos;s carrying on , and it &apos;s suddenly getting serious and perhaps less .
eighty-five percent of global health care is in the developing world -- not in the west -- not in the west -- and yet 90 percent of the resources in the west .
just to treat . look at the situation in the .
but if you tell them , we &apos;re trying to do the same in nigeria , all of the continued .
it allows the existence of <unk> centers , and we can use the experience very smart .
and what we need to be part of the solution is that we care about it .
and we &apos;re starting to start a <unk> program program so that we can bring local people to fix the equipment .
now , autism has a very large range , very large -- the child is not growing language -- to brilliant scientists and engineers .
i love the movie , which you &apos;ve all my projects , and that &apos;s the weirdo in me .
well , what i learned early , because i wasn &apos;t so <unk> , is to sell my work and not me .
another thing is sensory problems .
in other words , a problem with the equipment of a <unk> .
the movie is called <unk> .
i made a <unk> during the building industry , and i built things and learned how to do things .
another idea is that the children of some of the many <unk> <unk> have to be teaching .
tg : so i &apos;m passionate about the things that i do make the world better .
it &apos;s a extended reality that projections can follow and <unk> systems , or just a digital storyteller .
the fifth time i stand on this coast , the <unk> , i &apos;m looking out at the far horizon and i think , again , i &apos;m going to do it all the way across the long , dangerous wilderness of a ocean .
but it deeper , how much life is there ?
and then there &apos;s our contention that i never really tell you how far it is , because we don &apos;t know how far it is .
but honestly , all of these talks that i had had just just to just survive the <unk> , they were very different .
thank you and much fun at the conference .
and that &apos;s maybe the most important , he lost his self-worth .
he joins the army . the army gives him a rifle .
so what happens when a medium suddenly puts a lot of new ideas into circulation ?
they had to synchronize , which knew what other philosophers knew , and you couldn &apos;t get the right kind of discussion .
but there was a programmer who decided that wasn &apos;t the best way to do .
all of them can do changes , and they can do them <unk> , even if they don &apos;t know anything about the existence of each other before .
this is called a &quot; <unk> , &quot; this thing on the right .
something that can happen to a culture is that it can make a new <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , right ?
try to do what others do , a little bit better , because that doesn &apos;t get very far .
and if somebody tells you that you can &apos;t hear it , then you don &apos;t hear it .
six to nine months to the most impressive season .
but we &apos;ve tested this rovers , before we put them there -- or this one rover -- and they made everything work .
so we sent a spacecraft on mars to mars called phoenix . this probe is land in 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds , so you can put your clocks .
and that would be bad .
we &apos;re talking while we &apos;re talking to the next rover that we want to be to mars .
and i know many of you have the last time , that these airbags are really cool things .
there were two <unk> that were particularly interested in .
it &apos;s kind of like the cycle on earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it can &apos;t be water , because water would frozen .
today i want to talk to you about how these exponentially growing technologies are .
so we &apos;re looking at how exponentially growing technology is affecting health care .
this is an example of this <unk> .
there are wireless wireless .
and i think many of these technologies will help us be connected with our patients and take more time to focus on the important , human elements of medicine that are augmented through this kind of technology .
the current trend in medicine is , but , to be exponentially smaller .
when we go to genomics , when 10 years ago , the first human record was done , the cost of about a billion dollars .
thanks to websites like <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> or <unk> of their data on <unk> <unk> or google health , it &apos;s increasingly important to use all these ways in a more peaceful way .
we used the cells from the bone marrow to treat a patient with heart heart , we realized a <unk> and higher <unk> , the use of its own <unk> cells to a heart attack .
my poem is called &quot; dirt . &quot;
her cats , god knows how many that <unk> on her <unk> , her <unk> , her <unk> , a <unk> .
as you cross the <unk> , at stage to the street , <unk> , wouldn &apos;t look at me , &quot; can you help me ? &quot;
i was scared to be a <unk> part of control , and i would be stuck in the <unk> <unk> of your <unk> .
but i &apos;m afraid that <unk> come from and show me his <unk> .
if we love it , it keeps me around , around me , i &apos;m there , not there .
we &apos;re looking for images that drive the attention to critical topics , images that are <unk> , the religions , cross images that are inspiring us to do up and do something , to act with other words .
in &apos; 80s , the stigma was a tremendous obstacle to discuss about this disease , or mention it just to mention .
jonathan klein : photos that changed the world
i had read a lot of books and <unk> and <unk> .
i was able to see the flag strapped on the stick , well ... aah , a <unk> moment , and the music was going on to a <unk> .
finally , at the morning of the day , we got the <unk> . we <unk> the helicopter -- two helicopter in the <unk> -- which <unk> me on the edge of the <unk> .
i knew there were more open bodies , and i had a <unk> .
i had known that , but i expected that .
this was the view from my tent , when i got this <unk> call .
and just from the air i saw the big picture .
and they went around and wanted to go back to the coast , and all five died on the <unk> .
and that said a jewish man , so that &apos;s a lot .
but a few days later , we thought , well , we started with our students about this , and we said , &quot; what would happen if this <unk> guy wasn &apos;t in that condition ?
one day , <unk> miles from the coast of <unk> , one of the most remote areas of the pacific , saw 20 american <unk> of their ship in the sea .
but at some point , most of the things that are giving up like this , adults are adults , and adults are adults .
they have the same structure .
some of us tend to more more than read their fears than others .
now , it &apos;s really an amazing gift of imagination , a kind of <unk> , a kind of <unk> in the life , a way to look at the future , if there &apos;s time to affect your appearance .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
we brought them in every living room in the arab world -- international , global , through our english channel .
they were separated from their people , from the masses , and we see them collapse , one after another .
thank you very much .
because we discovered that it was taking people , and people want to be informed -- they receive the <unk> of the <unk> through our internet .
and frankie said , &quot; i &apos;m a 22 , and i see the needle going on me , and there &apos;s blood everywhere .
you want to share a needle just as little as you want to share a toothbrush , even with someone you &apos;re talking to .
so this is a overview of all of the studies of all the major animals in the united states , and these are the studies that show that <unk> are effective , quite many of them .
so you can see these grim images of africa .
now i say , oh , great <unk> .
ines is a <unk> on the streets . it &apos;s a girl with tail .
she was 105 years old , when i took this photograph of her .
hey , hey black-eyed susie , hey .
and a little bit of banjo . here comes a little <unk> .
we were with the car at <unk> , texas , where i spent my early childhood .
and mother just was just the car .
let &apos;s try it with this old song . i sing : there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , i know .
originally , the <unk> <unk> that later , the <unk> , an instrument with <unk> body and <unk> , where the sound comes .
well , that &apos;s easier than done .
we weren &apos;t stupid : we were turning a piece of plywood in about five feet away .
so , as a <unk> , thought thought , why can &apos;t you take the oldest <unk> , the &quot; <unk> &quot; rhythms and combine it with the latest technique ?
well , i think it works because scientists are connected to a collective .
it &apos;s significant to show the place in the room because it &apos;s critical , not in terms of where other things are , but in terms of this absolute notion of space that was known for newton god .
and in a relational universe , the only possible explanation was that it was kind of creating itself .
and you understand some things better than others , and therefore there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> and giving and taking , and that &apos;s politics .
there &apos;s another tedster who was here two years ago , jonathan haidt , who defined his work in three different levels .

i have some that thought that thought that was between five and 15 , this was going to be my <unk> , and this led to a sense of failure .

people always say consciousness is hard to define .
you can &apos;t match your own consciousness .
it &apos;s a digital computer computer computer in the brain and and it &apos;s a conscious computer , and we need to only find the right program .
we &apos;re constantly bringing objectivity and subjectivity as the properties of reality and as a sense of entitlement .

and it worked quite well to today .
and i &apos;ll allow you to take the concert , and i &apos;ll give you the music , and should ever decide to sell them , you have to sign a agreement that says that the money to support school . &quot;
this is a room that was built for nancy wilson , who was her album in our school last christmas .
the brown building , which you &apos;ve looked at you , and i tell you where i made my biggest mistake .

bill <unk> shares a calm and powerful story of salvation through art , music and unusual .
and the transducer does the <unk> to <unk> the code to the brain , and the result is a <unk> that produces a normal blood flow .

i &apos;m saying that &apos;s ridiculous .
we know that there &apos;s these threshold because we don &apos;t get a <unk> supply , before we reach a <unk> age , and although the damage since before we have been born .

immediately , the government said , &quot; enough -- we &apos;ll go . &quot; and paid people to every single person you saw .
he may think he &apos;s ever born the baby baby baby , so he might need a little bit of the outside .
i asked peter if something changed . and he said , &quot; no . &quot;
so we want to go to &quot; africa : the next chapter , &quot; and this is : a healthy , more , beautiful , beautiful african .
but most of all , they have to be productive in their lives , and create a kind of productive environment in our countries , so that things can be done .
we can do it all together ?
we were on the side of the <unk> .
i had to go through the legs of these people , with my sister on my back , to find a window .
you know , we need to use everything well .
and i often see the african employees among them .
the question now is , how can we use that from all this good will we come from ?
you &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
we have <unk> <unk> in nigeria with the <unk> .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is effectively a product product , i took this thesis for we can study them , just as we can study any other complex neurological process .
the method has been applied since the 90s to study extremely complex processes .
i want to show you a little bit about this for you .
and then i &apos;m in the control room , here , games in the change .
now , how do you study rap scientifically ?
there &apos;s an enormous brain activity that &apos;s going on in <unk> .
i want to say , probability and statistics , that &apos;s the mathematics of games and <unk> .
it &apos;s very time-consuming , and it &apos;s not pleasant .
but it &apos;s all the time for eight seconds .
in play and virtual worlds , for example , your facial expressions can be used and intuitively used to control a avatar or virtual character .
otherwise , she &apos;s very fast , and without a stable electric power , that &apos;s not possible , so children die .
another statement of esther was that we react to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s produced by the <unk> , and it &apos;s a very interesting <unk> substance .
we have every street , every village , almost every square centimeter of madagascar .
in your blink , a very cheap blue laser is .
audience : aye .
but what &apos;s interesting is , although we &apos;ve been <unk> all the time , we never never done it to <unk> the <unk> in the air .
this is the restaurant <unk> house .
this is a <unk> that you &apos;re seeing here growing in a <unk> , which is taken from the outside to the outside and <unk> .
so , water is a important aspect .
you &apos;re out of the earth .
the idea is not yet yet .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touches the water , you should hear how air is coming out .
once we sequenced these two genomes , we asked ourselves , if this is the smallest genome of a species that could be , could there be even smaller genome of it ?
moreover , we realized that once that worked , a real chance of a real chance would have , if we could bring the synthetic chromosome to it it .
so , care is <unk> .
the last one is a quote from robert feynman , &quot; what i can &apos;t do myself , i can &apos;t understand that . &quot;
but actually , here we live in northwest very close to the actual notion of paradise , the <unk> , the 36 times as &quot; gardens , <unk> by <unk> streams . &quot;
but the more you add , the more you get lost .
and this number of 72 never before .
this is a nests colony colony , and this is the nest entrance .
this is a colony that has been founded by a queen in the previous summer .
the <unk> -- this is supposed to be a magnifying glass -- they &apos;re an interesting group . they go out in the morning before the first group is up on foraging .
oddly enough , and interestingly , it looks like about half the ant colony just does nothing .
the nest maintenance workers just take all the <unk> and bring them to the <unk> edge of the <unk> and and put it there .
the foragers , somehow , they don &apos;t get out .
and we &apos;ve done experiments that show that the longer one ant is spreading out , the more easily the simple <unk> of the surface are changing , and so the ants vary different from doing different work .
they &apos;re all the entire earth , except the antarctica .
here you see the cost of this for the world in about 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost of at three trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s what we do for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do with it .
i have thought about where we can use the natural gas .
and as i went to the <unk> budget , it cost nine dollars .
why does &apos;t worry about that ?
that &apos;s just 500 million <unk> .
and it was never been polluted or <unk> .
tbp : i lost 150 million in the wind , ok ?
some have 5,000 . many have more .
there were <unk> . and there were <unk> .
life is a event . it &apos;s a <unk> .
these are work in <unk> manhattan , where you built the first offshore offshore .
these were in maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to go the light socket .
a friend of mine told me this story , they didn &apos;t just come and wait , but then the <unk> , when they finally had there , the third time they had to call someone .
so i &apos;m going to use a more clinical language , and so maybe not as you as you &apos;re going to talk about the heart of compassion in other conversations .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that <unk> people are doing good for people who are going to be <unk> for it .
basically , if you &apos;re my enemy or my <unk> , if you &apos;re not my friend or your family , i &apos;m much less to be the golden rule on you . okay .
so , the results are up , and that &apos;s a zero-sum game .
every form of the state , <unk> , <unk> , forcing you to acknowledge the humanity &apos;s humanity .
and then they &apos;ll explain to you that the other people think that america doesn &apos;t deserve it and and they hate to be , and they hate america .
most diseases of diseases are poverty , but in the case of children , the children who were dying of cancer , were mostly from wealthy families .
a child died every week , but nothing changed .
because simply simply not you can &apos;t take that kind of energy and time , if it doesn &apos;t really care .
so he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
well , the dominant <unk> would say that there is a single oncogene to be in a single cell cell , and that makes you a <unk> .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of <unk> material that was the right extracellular matrix , we put the cells in and lo and behold , , in about four days , they were <unk> and on the right , they see what we produced in a culture .
and of course , now , now , where are we going to go ?
and so i want to finish with a poem .
we have a <unk> journalist who was caught by the <unk> ; a young boy whose book was so many <unk> quotes , that you took it from shelves ; a <unk> over counterfeit <unk> in the new york times .
it sounds a little like a strange book , but it &apos;s actually new kinds of lying .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise !
you were sending four good friends of a person to do their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at lying ; i used to talk to them earlier .
they told how big the bath was , or said , &quot; the <unk> are so far off the hotel .
woman 2 : right there . okay , glass , take a picture !
and then you want to <unk> your eyes .
but it really opened my eyes , as often i &apos;ve gone from life to emails , social networks and so on , even though there was nothing really important or <unk> .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band of <unk> .
and everyone who &apos;s then <unk> , i went .
at least for me , because if i do just the same thing , very , very boring . i &apos;m very quickly .
i &apos;m like -- i don &apos;t know what i see .
are you going to be nervous , <unk> ?
im : do you worry ? you look so cute .
like , i don &apos;t say it &apos;s good , but it &apos;s not that it &apos;s not <unk> , ok ?
if you have the <unk> too long , it becomes buttermilk .
i call it the era of citizenship -- wherein what people gain different races or race race , but but as citizens can all be equally same .
in egypt , i was finally discovered .
this one in london studied in the yemen , and <unk> in amsterdam to a airplane to attack america .
there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that advocate for the democratic culture on the ground .
as an anecdote , we can show that if poverty is the only factor , well , your family is a of the richest families .
what happened there was a political coalition that was a political goal , and that was to remove the leaders .
these tools are only getting more interesting when they &apos;re technically bored .
he <unk> the boundaries of individual networks , and then they <unk> them .
and because of social networking , chinese students studying abroad , or companies from the rest of the world , were the offices in china , there were people all over the world that heard this news .
and finally , the chinese attacked .
we &apos;re increasingly in a media landscape in media media , social , ubiquitous and cheap .
but all in consider <unk> , i &apos;m still going to be as i &apos;m going to go .
my fourth <unk> , the snow , a comet , across the mountain . <unk> .
this view is the <unk> up the base , the first 600 meters of the base of the base camp .
and this is in camp 4 .
and there were climbers on this summit ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck <unk> , another climber , collapsed in this storm in the snow .
it &apos;s so terrifying to work up there , i sometimes had a <unk> , right through the clothes .
this climber was <unk> .
and i can just <unk> the way he did .
and so he &apos;s going to turn thoughts into actions .
these are sherpas who are <unk> <unk> .
and the fourth thing that &apos;s really important for me is &quot; ideas that we need to share with . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , by the <unk> rise , entrepreneurs became a , and they have a lot of to society .
they were well-meaning people who wanted democracy to introduce democracy because they were bringing ideas together , from universal <unk> , parliament and private and so on .
the third thing is again .
the second is the <unk> that we have , which is so difficult to promote the harsh jobs in companies that are 93 percent of indian jobs in the <unk> area .
so if you &apos;re a young country , you &apos;ve got the chance to introduce a modern <unk> , so that you don &apos;t have the <unk> when you &apos;re older .
you have to get a clear strategy , which is important for india and important for the world .
so the government decides to make it vote again .
even though some people on the left don &apos;t like to hear it , it was the revolution of the markets that the <unk> , the government : &quot; government has no idea . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t fear the crowds anymore .
so this whole constructive mistrust between the <unk> and the ones they represent .
<unk> .
each of these <unk> would statistically identified , two years after the chagos archipelago .
david cameron spends 20 million pounds into a social <unk> program to support this idea .
<unk> <unk> : investing in social change
i work on . &quot;
why ? are you too tired to get to the <unk> ?
even when i &apos;m with my friend named jack there , i say , &quot; i &apos;m going to jack . jack . jack , jack . &quot;
now , if you haven &apos;t figured out , my name is tom thum , and i &apos;m a <unk> , which means i &apos;ve just heard everything you &apos;ve heard , only with my voice , just with my voice .
and finally , with the end of this one , i can make my noises <unk> , <unk> , repeat .
our people had to try around 5,000 different <unk> to find the right thing .
don &apos;t listen to those who say you can &apos;t do it . anybody can do it .
on the right side , there &apos;s a <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to give you some examples .
you see the blue <unk> <unk> .
his wife said it was &quot; the happiest day in your life . &quot;
so many of those patients are going to pull the <unk> .
the results are better than the surgical .
he can stop the surgery anytime and immediately .
<unk> street , i know .
and that &apos;s where they really suck much of their creative inspiration , so it &apos;s a industry that goes in both directions .
and that &apos;s why they want to go to the nearest trend and get it as quickly as possible .
and their jokes , like the <unk> of a <unk> , are really just within these aesthetic .
you need a lot of lawyers and lots of trial , and the retailers have decided that it would be too expensive .
these are the two <unk> of pretty binary <unk> in the logic of the <unk> .
and i want to thank you <unk> , really , thank you for making this very <unk> presentation .
once once , a boat took me to a remote <unk> , and i noticed that the <unk> that i should meet were not <unk> .
i think this is one of the most <unk> and <unk> things on the planet .
there &apos;s a lot of ancient <unk> in the u.k. , and if you go to the u.k. , you &apos;ll notice that the <unk> of the churches were there before the churches .
here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , which is about <unk> years old .
i hope that by finding these organisms , i can help to find attention to their remarkable <unk> , and to contribute my part to the protection of their <unk> longevity in the future .
let &apos;s put it on something else .
20 years later , criminals are still using mobile phones , but they also create their own <unk> , like this one &apos;s used by the <unk> mexico in all 31 states .
what did they do with this ?
what could terrorists do today , using this technology technology ?
recently , the fbi arrested a <unk> in the u.s. states that this remote drones wanted to be transported from <unk> in <unk> in the u.s.
as we see here , we turn into <unk> .
now , the mortality rate is 70 percent when you get it , but it &apos;s hard .
there are so many people killed that the only <unk> funeral in <unk> <unk> <unk> like this one outside of <unk> &apos;s can be possible .
but on the other hand , i hear people like you &apos;re talking about fear , a certain aversion to risk .
and tragically , she was in 1999 when she was working in colombia with the u , with the goal of preserve her culture and language , with two more colleagues from the <unk> of the farc and and killed and killed .
and there &apos;s no group that would be more susceptible to this kind of manipulation that be young men .
patient capital is uncomfortable for the people who seek simple solutions , light categories , because we don &apos;t think of profit as a pure instrument .
but all the community , all different <unk> , also the <unk> and <unk> , would sit down and pray . &quot;
because the <unk> , when she comes full of the juice , she &apos;s beautiful , she &apos;s green , she &apos;s the world , she goes down to heaven . &quot;
but don faces ?
ok , let &apos;s take a look at these three portraits .
i tried to make a little pleasure in my wife .
why don &apos;t i put my wife &apos;s own , build sanitary pad pad ?
but here &apos;s the problem . because a company is making <unk> out of cotton and it works .
<unk> : i see this thing in my hands &apos;s hands , &quot; why do you have a nasty rag ? &quot;

very special material that the abalone cells make themselves , millions of abalone , all the time , every day , every year .
and the idea was , basically , i &apos;m the paintbrush in the hand of the great personalities that come and i would interview .
but i wanted to leave interviews that are different .
in fact , my first <unk> george abbott , who was 97 years old , and he was a lot of the power of life -- i think it &apos;s how you define it .

my topic is food in schools , because this is about social justice .
and the next is <unk> .

europe had to be <unk> into economic development .

so what &apos;s wrong ? why is there that so-called &quot; <unk> &quot; ?
and so the countries of the bottom billion need a very <unk> politics .
a few economists came up in the moment and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try a auction ? she &apos;s going to reveal the value . &quot;
in that moment , in the world , a billion people are stuck in poor or low-income countries , how can we help them ? the economist paul collier asks a brave , compassionate plan that we can close the gap between poor and rich .

when peter moves his arm , this yellow spot that you see there is the <unk> location of action that &apos;s in <unk> mind .

on the left-hand side , you can see edward <unk> .
we live in a world of <unk> technologies , and these technologies can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s always easier to break , it &apos;s easier to break than they &apos;re together .
but then we have to talk about well-being in a wider context .
and what is his natural enemy , what the means of the good good to the good beetle that we &apos;re talking about ?
it &apos;s a parasite , it &apos;s not a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> , two <unk> long , <unk> , a fast and <unk> <unk> .

this is just used to show that if you have cameras or some other sensors because it &apos;s high , it &apos;s a foot 80 , you can be about obstacles about <unk> and <unk> .
for example , in this case , although the left and right wheel is connected to a single axis , and therefore &apos;s just the same speed .
welcome to <unk> , the robot mechanics of <unk> <unk> . &quot;
but the cool thing about this is the <unk> .
let &apos;s see how he does . this was our first first attempt , and ...
but what is the secret of our success ?

but in the last couple of decades , a lot of money was determined for the british , completely gone .
and going out to the neighbors of what they buy for food and where and why and why , a homework homework .
in these , it &apos;s really impossible to create large predators surfaces .
i want to invite you to follow my journey of <unk> and explore .
after four months of rainy , it came out and now he &apos;s eight months of dry .
here &apos;s a couple results .
this global action is the global climate change , as it does , , as it &apos;s going to do fossil fuels , maybe even more than that .
when i learned about these two things , i was very excited about both personal reasons and science .
it has a very <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was part of the ronald foundation foundation .
after treatment , we &apos;re going to let the child a series of simple <unk> to see how his vision is .
and the answer is moving . i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss my wife for a long time .
we &apos;re tracking these <unk> , and hopefully we &apos;ll have more results .
and then , i went from these <unk> to <unk> disabled , and i thought , oh , oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i get about it , i &apos;ll look at how that is .
but that was in the fall &apos; 95 and then when winter was <unk> , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : well , then aimee was able to do the <unk> in 1996 , and it &apos;s very excited . your family travels with -- it &apos;s a big deal .
i tried everybody i could , <unk> against who was coming out against who was going on , so who was i going to ?
i always had won everything , and now i thought , what ?
you can be <unk> big . just take off . &quot;
moderator : aimee and the designers will be two at ted <unk> two and we &apos;re going to talk about design .
they were clinging to someone who came over and <unk> the shoes .
it &apos;s almost impossible to see the actual losses of economy , unless we use copyright .
or the 75,000 jobs .
and something about the math : math sometimes sometimes looks like math -- like like math -- and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- how &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in the math math , we use about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to do step three of hand .
so , people ask me , is this true ?
but the automation of the in cars allowed to separate these things , so that &apos;s something else that &apos;s going on today , and it &apos;s a car that &apos;s learning a car and learning of its <unk> .
totally wrong .
but i think we can do both the same time .
and one of the reasons why it &apos;s so important -- so , it &apos;s very important to put computer in the test .
it was in 2009 , and i was blind for about a year .
i thought particularly about my father , who passed away from complications of an surgical device .
similarly , just like you , just by the grasp of the land , changing the soil of the soil , and over time , a idea of where you are and what you &apos;re talking about .
but when i was <unk> and i went along broadway , i was blessed at every corner .
if you design a city in the blind sense of the blind , there will be many , many jobs .
to give you a sense of this experience , the article called &quot; i think you can relax . &quot;
and the <unk> of the famous ones i knew -- the ten commandments , love your next , be fertile and <unk> you ...
you get money for a good purpose and you get emotional sympathy for it .
she &apos;s not a book written and written by the sky .
so for me , that &apos;s really the key to me , to remind me that the way here , the car doesn &apos;t <unk> itself , and i &apos;m not going to climb up on the way across the stairs .
and that was very inspiring for me .
so if we want to kind of a meaning , we really need to go on to it , and say , and say it .
so we have this wonderful progress .
the academics , they were thinking about this , so we evolved <unk> applications like this <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> of a <unk> is going to be a laser .
alex worked on a small , <unk> <unk> , named minority report , &quot; minority report &quot; for steven <unk> , and invited us to develop the interface that &apos;s going to be used in the movie .
we &apos;re doing this <unk> operation because we like yellow and yellow and <unk> .
let &apos;s pull the apart : i bring it in <unk> .
we , as humans , are the things that make things , and we should make sure our machines help us and build on it .
john , thank you for making a scientific reality .
what okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point . the <unk> creative act is still an creative act .
but the institutions that are being shown by this black line said , &quot; we &apos;re changing this deal immediately .
they &apos;re created by the members of the community for each other .
and like all good <unk> , she makes a leap from 20 years of the time of the audience changes .
you don &apos;t always have five days . so , changes came , and we started playing <unk> .
india was not going to play in the <unk> game .
the other one was cricket cricket .
was this the new india ? this was another world where you could get some players from anywhere , as long as you get the best player for the best .
we &apos;ve all seen games in calcutta , but we &apos;ve never seen before . <unk> khan brought the audience with a <unk> song for calcutta -- for calcutta , not for india , but for calcutta .
could you imagine that day would come ?
hopefully i &apos;ve made each of you all about an experience , and the game is popular , and hopefully there &apos;s a longer time to work in this business .
and you know that the dogs &apos; dogs are , because they have been <unk> in memory , how often they &apos;ve seen dogs and pigs at the crossroads .
why in the world should anyone play ping-pong ?
on the other hand , if you visit a developing country and for 25 dollars a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> for a big mac .
would you spend your $ 20 dollars for a ticket ?
let me give you an example .
and if the way to the other end of the city , 100 mice is worth 100 bucks , it &apos;s worth 100 bucks , they &apos;re not generally <unk> , but people don &apos;t think that way .
well , in large , it &apos;s enormous enormously impatient .
watch what happens when we paste <unk> .
dan , i would like to hear more . so you say our answer to terrorism is , i mean , it &apos;s a kind of mental error ?
there are no guns going there .
and so some people on economists are looking at economists as dumb people .
topic and variation is one of these brain mechanisms that requires a certain intellectual activity , because you always have the variation with the subject that you have in mind .
&quot; <unk> in words and in fashion , the same rule / awesome great rule is to new or too old , not the first thing new to the old one is the last one that the old one ever put on since . &quot;
and i woke up one day and said , &quot; well , maybe that &apos;s not ? &quot;
first , my willingness to get me to a critical audience without too , i am sure of my thing .
it &apos;s my intention of <unk> the poster , <unk> , and you don &apos;t have to understand it .
so , in the large , and all of them , they &apos;re survival .
jews often have a uncomfortable smell smell .
if the space was <unk> , we could see that people were adding more negative attitudes to <unk> men .
it &apos;s like i &apos;d be <unk> to talk about what i &apos;ve done in those 20 years .
it &apos;s <unk> my spirit and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other <unk> , and they talk about what cinema means .
without a food , i became sick .
we don &apos;t need more more to go out the idiots !
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the idea that we have all these kids , it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of kids having so much psychological trauma or damage to africa , and africa has to live with it .
through the whole book , more than an hour of <unk> <unk> and interactive animations .
what is the business about this ?
it was at least that you , whatever , mostly true to be true .
so i thought , &quot; yeah , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
they &apos;re still talking about it .
when i came from college , i worked in southern california , and you were to to the spanish <unk> on the roofs and things like that .
rsw : what about the schedule ?
the <unk> -- they sent me to mit and sent their technical <unk> to bilbao .
that reminds me of it .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; what , what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you take four with three wishes , the ideas will be more and more powerful .
and one thing i wanted to mention at my inbox , but somehow missed , was to thank all the companies that helped me .
but in the meantime , these things are winning on momentum .
and this is 10 weeks later , by hand .
you see the suits , the <unk> .
the <unk> of <unk> and things are remarkable , and this is what the <unk> are supposed to be .
it &apos;s an incredible endeavor , 15,000 workers , i think , five domes , and the sixth is built here .
on this level , work on 1,500 workers .
50 percent of the computers on the world are going to the recycling in china .
it was quite unusual , so stefan , that less than five percent of advertising had a picture of a picture .
and wish three is : <unk> . i was told i should make myself one , and i always wanted to do something like this .
and it becomes increasingly important that we can figure out how to get these resources from these extremely complex <unk> .
the traditional ways of dividing material is just not working for <unk> .
the traditional way to make it <unk> happens to oil or petrochemicals .
and at the end of this process , we have a mixed <unk> : many different kinds of <unk> and lots of different qualities of plastics .
now i see a lot of <unk> out there .
and what we see is that people tend to commit mistakes in the same way , again and again .
maybe we should study how monkeys make economic decisions and find out whether they make the same <unk> as we do .
here &apos;s mayday . she &apos;s going to exchange a token against food and waits for them to eat and get food .
they &apos;re going to make a little bit odd for the market open .
now imagine that i give each 1,000 dollars in dollars in your hand -- 10 hundred bucks a hundred dollars .
you can either pick a <unk> loss -- so i throw a coin . at head , you &apos;re going to lose a lot .
if we made the same scenarios in our little <unk> , would they do the same things that people do ?
the person on the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just the people on the last stage of development that make stupid mistakes .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but when we think of wood , the most often , are just four stories tall .
we have to do less with concrete and steel , and we have to build up , recently , we &apos;ve worked on <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s just as much as if we have a 100,000 cars less than the streets in a year .
<unk> curtains <unk> my windows .
maybe even citizens , because recently they &apos;ve stood up to fight the threats of justice , the citizens of these networks work together to help each other .
<unk> , the largest and oldest bank in russia , largely in the trade of the russian government , now uses <unk> to engage employees and citizens in innovation .
we &apos;ve heard talking about people that have been hacked with the plants , and <unk> , working on the world , making young people to create websites and making videos .
and so i started thinking that the eternal mother always asks , &quot; are all the children there ? &quot;
that &apos;s compassion .
he asked them to run a message , and all of their language in their own language , a central policy strategy , which was a version of the golden rule , &quot; what you don &apos;t want to do is to do you not to others . &quot;
to be a pastor means to take care of these individual needs .
and we do this by some <unk> .
there are about 180 messages in washington d.c.
it &apos;s already taken by parks and sculptures .
it &apos;s made of fiber fiber fiber .
there &apos;s also some constraints in the lighting .
the bubble is a <unk> .
i saw my aunt raped when i was only five .
one of the things i experienced when i was trying to eat my friend , because we had no food and we were about 400 .
as a child , as young as a child , i can &apos;t forget , not forget .
this is my story , <unk> in a lesson / a lesson .
my breakfast , my lunch , i &apos;m driving a foundation that i founded , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the farmers to build tools .
audience : aye .
the third chapter is a even more complicated <unk> called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
that means more than 60 percent are for that .
we &apos;re the best way to do that by getting the problem of death death .
and even when that happens , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing from the time i was five years old .
santa &apos;s santa knows , was you <unk> or not . right ? &quot;
but , julie , you were like ready for school . you were so ready . &quot;
they looked at each other and they were , in the sense , that was the right answer . then they said , &quot; do you think we &apos;re all brothers and sisters on this earth ? &quot;
maybe your greater ability to cooperate and adapt ?
i think this film shows the toughest view of the modern times : &quot; the world . &quot;
in world second world , we had to make a lot of stuff .
but we can &apos;t forget that it needs to make a basic contribution for it , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but now , the good news !
she &apos;s probably in latin america .
and at this point the skeptics and <unk> of climate change in vision .
we did a project a few years ago , a project called the <unk> -- the <unk> -- the <unk> -- with many , many people -- many experts were involved -- it &apos;s a thicker <unk> .
a group of them , they spend , it &apos;s for themselves , and the other group is to spend on other people .
when they went to the second building , all of the time , they were running by a man who was <unk> and <unk> , and clearly help , and the question is : did they stop and helped ?
the word is &quot; <unk> , &quot; a combination of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &quot; stuff : &quot; <unk> life : <unk> life .
since -- it &apos;s been four decades passed -- i was training with the best in this area , had a lot of documents , young people , and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> a a <unk> web of art , successes and accolades .
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my real life life .
i danced between <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and i put it in my <unk> .
well , it was essentially frustration .
it was like it was then .
he put them together to something more <unk> , and then he proved it to this software that i think originally had originally developed his son , and he made this wonderful presentation .
in these documents , there &apos;s little <unk> , little boxes .
i want to suggest -- yes , do you create a beautiful website , and how could i say you shouldn &apos;t make beautiful website ?
now , you ask the linked data that you &apos;ve put together , 32 hits , which each one of which is protein with these properties , and you can look at them .
and that &apos;s what linked data is about .
all of this will lead to two million children every year , in the last year than in 2000 .
and so , if it is , we &apos;re ready to collect feedback and give feedback to make sure that the ceremonies , really , results results ?
you just show one of the numbers there , the 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers started to me and draw tips for drawing and paint .
and that &apos;s exactly what fascinated me to explore this field .
how many of you have a cow over the street , looking at bangalore to mysore ?
it &apos;s just as people who we are trained to be able to perceive reality , and that makes meaning .
and they said , &quot; okay .
can &apos;t you make anything out of anything , you &apos;re artists ? &quot;
this is a box from <unk> .
because , if we see somebody , we see the footprint .
what percentage of that have foreign <unk> ?
obviously , he &apos;s been in a cave for the last 20,000 years .
so the <unk> is actually really very designed to get here , because -- if you think about it , i &apos;ve said today about economists today , that most things are very <unk> .
this is the place i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re going to do something technical now .
think about toyota .
you can &apos;t <unk> it , so you accept it and you find a way to work with it .
it &apos;s very hard to get .
it &apos;s <unk> and galvanize .
you &apos;ll get pizza if you have hunger .
there are millions of different varieties of water .
so remember if we think about sexual education and activity , you &apos;re out of baseball .
it &apos;s the poet <unk> chen and goes up , &quot; i can &apos;t violate the <unk> .
and that &apos;s , &quot; how percentage of the day do you think of that person ? &quot;
in over the societies , people were leaving <unk> of these <unk> <unk> .
they came home with <unk> percent of the paycheck home .
and it became really a strong force .
and i said , &quot; well , why do you think men are more malleable than women ? &quot;
not at that time , there were the women that were so educated , so interesting , so interesting .
she &apos;s been her in her , she was been 13 .
i began to <unk> why you love to love one person in love than others .
they &apos;re going to be long as long as the human race is on what shakespeare called &quot; this triangular spiral . &quot;
but unfortunately , i know .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should be wondering if it could be that the insulin resistance is the cause of growth and <unk> disease -- at least in most people ?
others , it too much <unk> .
peter <unk> : what if our views were more diabetes ?
my great-grandfather , henry ford , really believed that it was the mission of ford motor company to make the life of people better and make cars for every affordable .
and the good news is that today we &apos;re going to lead the big problems of cars and environment -- not just ford , but as a industry .
i think you can imagine it .
but what really inspired me is the ways that we will have when our cars start to communicate with each other .
we need an infrastructure that is able to support this flexible future .
this is a minute <unk> .
i think now my mother , i &apos;m a kind of a <unk> .
the nurses have to go up with this .
that &apos;s really important . it &apos;s much . &quot;
so what happened to that ?
for us , it was great , because we won a lot of awards .
i was infected when i was 17 , when a student student , a <unk> , i was actually adults who believed in my ideas , <unk> and many <unk> <unk> with me .
now it was all about the children . so we don &apos;t <unk> .
we basically gave the kids a simple task .
for our auction , we have some wonderful images for you , for a really good purpose , the money they give us , is used to buy hearing .
but what i &apos;ve never said , and what i want to do is that <unk> is cool .
in a way , in the elegant or <unk> product , we have <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> , which is another kind of development -- and inspired by the incredible kind of experience .
if you think about the change in our society , the <unk> of the country in the cities that took 200 years , the same process happens in 20 years .
it looked ahead , even though these were even unknown .
this is how we would put models under a artificial sky .
i think an average percent reduction in 94 percent of pure pure .
and how do we do something in this growing world , especially in some places i talk -- china , for example , that will build 400 new airports .
and this is the focus of the talk talk -- there &apos;s no lighting in the positive sense that is healthy and our well-being , without proper darkness .
in contrast to the first office i showed you at the beginning of the talk , this is a very famous office office , which is the <unk> .
behind you , the <unk> building , which later become a <unk> icon of modern modern .
i find what you &apos;re seeing here quite amazing -- how much light in the sky is coming and never reach the ground .
it &apos;s not very pleasant and <unk> .
they &apos;re not going to mess up .
when our college age , as a few weeks ago , a war in a third of india , called about 200 <unk> who are <unk> , he &apos;s eluded the issue .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while i was on the office , i could see a <unk> , or it came to me that i could be like a <unk> , the life would be wonderful .
ag : but what is it going to use ? what was it used ?
to do what to do , to break rocks .
that &apos;s the only place she could express her creativity .
they don &apos;t want to have a second choice of standards and standards .
and that &apos;s what sheikh <unk> &apos;s <unk> did .
i had to be my favorite .
<unk> <unk> , who lives with a physical challenge , is only 50 inches .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> .
these are <unk> billion people .
or ski . it &apos;s just fun and people love to do things like <unk> and fun things .
so we worked very , very hard , but we knew it &apos;s not so hard to develop the technology that what &apos;s important and how technology can be used .
cars are not made for park side-by-side ; it &apos;s wonderful <unk> to drive them between cities and forth , but think about it , we &apos;ve solved all the problems in terms of range and speed .
so if we could bring this box back here , a few years , we could have a solution for transportation , electricity , and communication , and maybe drinking water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds ?
now , implicit or explicitly , the people who are dying , are kind of involved in the drugs , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing to do is either tortured or professional or or or or or or or or or professional .
we &apos;re going to be <unk> as a <unk> of psychopaths that spread fear and horror in cities and bring the press to silence , and that &apos;s true most of the time .
so in mexico and the u.s. , now is to an truly international organization , the partnerships in the south and global partnerships in global health .
but also part of being a veteran &apos;s <unk> magazine -- you live in the future , and we have a long time delay .
and after she &apos;s under a critical price , she &apos;s going to be successful , if she &apos;s successful , about a critical mass , a breakthrough .
but they &apos;re very , very cheap , and look at the interesting impacts . when you get cheaper , you lose the brands , the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , you win .
if you look at the , linux is in red , it has 20 percent .
open open , &quot; really , you know , the gift of the silicon valley to the world .
so , of some of the technologies we &apos;ve talked about .
patient capital is in between , and it &apos;s trying to take the best out of the two .
the second thing was that it had to be extremely cheap .
president obama understands that .
because one of the poorest farmers in the world had access to a technology that allowed him to change his life .
and yet , these are the characteristics , for the men and women , and they &apos;re honored by all generations .
you remember , during the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in his blog , and he often often <unk> it , and it was possible because blogs are easy to use .
i like music , and i like <unk> , and i think i heard steve martin play and told me that i can .
i wrote this post , and i took this for einstein today .
and you see this post .
these little things are .
and maybe i have to <unk> because i &apos;m talking about it when i talk about it .
it has been sustainable since the time , except from our generation .
we need to use this procedure immediately to get a better understanding of the way the oceans works .
we studied these fish review , but first we had to learn how to keep it .
but it &apos;s only half the size of the biggest tuna we &apos;ve ever tagged .
they come together . this could be sex under the . and there it is .
you can take a lure -- it &apos;s <unk> like a seal -- and a white shark will go on it , a <unk> creature that gets <unk> close to our 16 feet .
and then these animals give us a <unk> , help us .
and the white shark .
i think he didn &apos;t think that the records of my face were so accurate .
they said , &quot; besides the that we &apos;ve talked about , are you groups that want to harm the united states ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to waste your energy .
now , who look at my <unk> , i was there , and i know that i &apos;ve been in the ninth of hollywood for $ <unk> in the safeway .
all of the few moments i &apos;m pressing a <unk> on my life .
when i started the project , people started , &quot; why would you want to say all of you , what you are and where you are ?
it &apos;s now normal .
now , look at this <unk> of paris to see how incredibly quickly is growth .
i &apos;ve looked at thousands of these <unk> and trust and efficiency always have elements .
how do we evaluate how trust of face-to-face is built ?
i was kind of a spirit in the system .
this site is given to a day of <unk> questions and 80 percent of it &apos;s a precise answer .
i want to start with a paradox .
and here you see it in relation to the degree of inequality i showed you that i &apos;m going to come back to .
first of all , with the rich , developed countries , and then in a second <unk> , the 50 american states -- in the same question : do the more more likely to turn up the more states on all this scales ?
with devastating effects , the benefits of the people are affected .
and in our analysis of the american states , we find the same thing .
the socially <unk> judgments , and fear of those of us .
or for example , why violence in more more societies is more powerful because people are sensitive to become <unk> .
over three million <unk> , a new knee or a new knee , or a <unk> .
you remember , like kamal gave the <unk> .
if you wear it under a black or a rock , or a sari , it &apos;s very clear that you wear a prosthetic , and you get to societies where disability is a social stigma , people are very sensitive .
so thank you .
you want to have a dirty magazine ?
i actually bought the <unk> <unk> . there &apos;s a little paper on the spot where , &quot; don &apos;t use these <unk> to <unk> juice juice . &quot;
this is the results one to 20 , and &quot; google just is just as many &quot; o &quot; as there are pages .
strong fear is you .
but if you were always in that condition , the work would never be done , because you would suddenly say , &quot; oh , i found a new way to make it . &quot;
almost all of us , we &apos;re doing , subconscious .
it &apos;s about being safe in this world .
if the amusement park would fall and fall apart , they would never have a ride .
it &apos;s a very small sample -- you shouldn &apos;t be able to get the results .
so i &apos;m going to talk about children and self-organization and a series of experiments that led me to the idea of how an alternative education might look like .
and on the evening of this day , <unk> 70 children on the internet .
and so i could actually choose some to meet a intersection that included the whole world .
and what you see see is obviously a child that &apos;s doing this computer .
natural systems are all <unk> : galaxies , molecules , cells , organisms , societies , societies -- except the discussion about the theory of &quot; smart designers . &quot;
and it &apos;s about the <unk> of idealism in this whole <unk> .
i bought with a nice suit and i was wearing shoes with <unk> and i emailed this remarkable access to i had to <unk> .
but 2002 , when my tour went to the end , i decided that i wasn &apos;t going to the job that was waiting for me in london .
i felt something was destroyed .
and i went through . i went through this crowd .
and i went to the kosovo and and i <unk> the government there .
independent diplomat is part of a trends that comes out worldwide , obviously , and shows that the world is fragmented .
it &apos;s awful that you &apos;re these people who are actually affected , not <unk> .
that &apos;s the 21st century policy . and in a sense , independent diplomat is this <unk> , this change that happens with us all .
&quot; hey , could you even give me more ? &quot;
because when we go to the <unk> , they understood that this practice that a simple mistake can say , what you &apos;re not , or remember why you love something .
we feel awe , compassion .
here we go .
what is the number one ?
no . in the &apos; 70s , there were the <unk> show &quot; the <unk> , &quot; which went in 1973 , the top 10 , followed by the <unk> and &quot; three angels for charlie . &quot;
i can choose them from the island .
and i &apos;m very excited to discuss about that , i &apos;ll come in and say , &quot; can somebody tell me the key and why it &apos;s so cool ? &quot;
next , this <unk> stuff produced the <unk> <unk> .
for a number of reasons .
or worse , <unk> education is increasingly getting more like the guy who always says , &quot; actually ... &quot;
but we have a lot of work in front of us and if somebody &apos;s involved in science , i please to engage with me .
we climb up the stairs and we experience a state changed consciousness .
so many books on war say the same thing , which is that nothing people are so sophisticated together as war .
durkheim believed that everything that us us could be a <unk> .
he kept saying that &quot; <unk> and <unk> people will not be beaten , and without <unk> , can be moved . &quot;
it uses the other .
once they were all in a same tribe , they could keep the benefits of cooperation for themselves .
it &apos;s about connecting to others , to engage ethical ideas .
jh : thank you .
